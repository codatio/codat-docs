# Inclusive Language and Accessibility

## Ableist Language

Avoid ableist terms that marginalize people with disabilities.

**Avoid:**

- crazy, insane, blind to, cripple, dumb, lame, handicapped
- "sanity-check" → use "final check for completeness"
- "crazy outliers" → use "baffling outliers"

## Gendered Language

Replace gendered terms with neutral alternatives.

**Avoid → Use:**

- man-hours → person-hours
- mankind → humanity
- manpower → workforce, staffing
- he/she → they

## Violent Language

Avoid graphically violent or harmful terms.

**Replace violent metaphors:**

- Avoid figurative language like "hang," "kill," "hit," "abort" when possible
- Choose neutral alternatives that don't evoke violence

## Diverse Examples

Create inclusive examples in your documentation.

### Name Diversity

Use diverse names, genders, ages, and locations in examples.

**Example names to consider:**

- Avoid only Western names
- Include names from various cultures
- Use gender-neutral names when appropriate

### Gender-Neutral Pronouns

Consistently use "they/them" for singular references.

### Avoid US-Centric References

- Don't assume US location, currency, or cultural context
- Use international date formats
- Specify timezone when relevant

## Writing About Older Adults

**Recommended:**

- "older adults"
- "aging population"

**Avoid:**

- "elderly"
- "seniors"
- "the aged"

## Disability and Accessibility

### Describe People Appropriately

**Don't:**

- Describe nondisabled people as "normal" or "healthy"
- Use terms like "wheelchair-bound" or "confined to a wheelchair"

**Do:**

- Use neutral terms: "uses a wheelchair"
- Research community preferences for identity-first vs. person-first language
- Note: The Deaf community often prefers "Deaf person" (identity-first)

## Features and Technical Terms

### Socially Charged Terms

Replace socially charged technical terms.

**Avoid → Use:**

- blacklist → denylist, blocklist
- whitelist → allowlist, allowedlist
- master/slave → primary/replica, main/secondary

### Acknowledging Established Terms

For established industry terms, acknowledge the old term on first use:

"Use an allowlist (sometimes called a whitelist) to specify..."

### Divisive Categorizations

**Avoid:**

- "native speakers" vs. "non-native speakers"
- "normal users" vs. other categorizations
- Assumptions about user capabilities

## General Principle

When in doubt, choose language that:

- Respects all people
- Doesn't perpetuate stereotypes
- Focuses on what people do, not who they are
- Considers the global, diverse audience
