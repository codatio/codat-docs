This includes, but is not strictly limited to:

- A payment made against a bill — for example, a credit card payment, cheque payment, or cash payment.
- An allocation of a supplier's credit note to a bill or perhaps a refund.
- A bill payment made directly to an accounts payable account. This could be an overpayment or a prepayment, or a refund of a payment made directly to an accounts payable account.
