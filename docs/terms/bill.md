hoverText: Bills are invoices that represent the SMB's financial obligations to their supplier for a purchase of goods or services.

In Codat, a bill contains details of:

- When the bill was recorded in the accounting system.
- How much the bill is for and the currency of the amount.
- Who the bill was received from — the supplier.
- What the bill is for — the line items.

Some accounting platforms give a separate name to purchases where the payment is made immediately, such as something bought with a credit card or online payment. One example of this would be QuickBooks Online's expenses.

You can find these types of transactions in our Direct costs data model.

### Invoices or bills?

We distinguish between invoices where the company owes money vs. is owed money. If the company has received an invoice, and owes money to someone else (accounts payable) we call this a Bill.

See Invoices for the accounts receivable equivalent of bills.
