title: Bank feed
hoverText: A bank feed is a digital connection between a bank (or another financial institution) and a software application, which allows for the automatic and regular transfer of financial data from the bank account into the software.

This technology has become an essential feature in modern accounting and personal finance software. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics and uses:

Real-time Updates: Many bank feeds offer near real-time updates, which means transactions can appear in the connected software shortly after they are made.

Automation: The automatic importation of transactions reduces the need for manual data entry, reducing both time spent and the risk of human error.

Reconciliation: With transactions automatically imported, reconciling accounts (matching and comparing the bank statement to the accounting record) becomes a more streamlined process.

Security: Bank feeds are designed with security in mind. They often use read-only access, meaning that while the software can view and retrieve transaction data, it cannot initiate transactions or move money.

Applications:

Accounting Software: Tools like QuickBooks, Xero, and FreshBooks use bank feeds to automate the process of recording and categorizing transactions.
Personal Finance Software: Applications like Mint or YNAB use bank feeds to help users track their income, spending, and overall financial health.
Direct and Indirect Feeds:

Direct Feeds: These are established directly between the bank and the software provider, often resulting in more reliable and faster data transfer.
Indirect Feeds: These utilize third-party aggregators to retrieve transaction data. While they can connect to a broader range of institutions, they might be less stable or slower than direct feeds.
Connection Methods: Different technologies underpin bank feeds, such as Open Banking APIs (in regions like Europe) and screen scraping.

Bank feeds have revolutionized the way both individuals and businesses manage their finances, offering an unprecedented level of automation and accuracy. However, users should always ensure that their financial software maintains strong security measures and that they are comfortable with the level of access they grant to these applications.
