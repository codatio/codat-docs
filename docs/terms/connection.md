A data connection represents a company's connection to a data source and allows you to synchronize data (read or write) with that source.

A company can have multiple data connections depending on the type of data source it is connecting to. For example, a single company can link to:

- Accounting data - 1 active connection.
- Banking data - Multiple active connections.
- Commerce data - Multiple active connections.

Any combination of accounting, banking, and commerce data connections is allowed.
