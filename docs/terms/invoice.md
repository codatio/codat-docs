An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a customer.

In Codat, an invoice contains details of:

- The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
- How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
- Who the invoice has been raised to; the customer.
- The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the line items.
- Any payments assigned to the invoice; the payment allocations.
