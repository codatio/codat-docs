Now you're ready to explore the functionality of the bill pay demo app in more depth. The user flow diagrams describe the demo app's functionality at a high level, while the example API calls show the exchange of data with the Codat API.

## Understand the auth flow

The company creation feature and authorization flow were built using the [Platform API](/platform-api#/) and [Hosted Link](/auth-flow/authorize-hosted-link). For a seamless user experience, we customized the Hosted Link flow with the same branding and colors as the demo app UI - see [Customize Link](/auth-flow/customize/customize-link) for more details.

Its main features are:

- Creating a company to represent the user using the [Create company](/sync-for-payables-api#/operations/create-company) endpoint. This returns a unique company ID and Link URL.
- Redirecting the user to their chosen accounting software via the Link URL. This opens the OAuth login window for the accounting software, where the user can authenticate and authorize access to their accounting data. 
- Creating a data connection to the accounting software using the [Create connection](/sync-for-payables-api#/operations/create-connection) endpoint.
- When the company is successfully connected, redirecting the user to the demo app's redirect URL, as defined in the [Link settings](/auth-flow/customize/customize-link).

## View bills

The following diagram illustrates the user flow for viewing bills in the demo app UI.

```

### Fetch bills

When launched, the demo app retrieves a list of all bills from your sandbox QuickBooks Online company, in descending order of issue date, using the [List bills](/sync-for-payables-api#/operations/list-bills) endpoint.

Here is an example request:

<Tabs>

    }
  }
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info View unpaid bills query
When the **View unpaid bills only** toggle is selected in the UI, the `&query=status=Open` query is appended to the request URL as a [Codat query string](/using-the-api/querying). This returns only unpaid bills.
:::

### Fetch accounts

When launched, the demo app uses the [List accounts](/sync-for-payables-api#/operations/list-accounts) endpoint to fetch the company's latest accounts. The account name is displayed against its respective bill in the **Reference** column of the bills table.

Here is an example request:

<Tabs>

## Pay a bill

The following diagram illustrates the user flow for selecting and paying a bill in the demo app UI.

:::note User flow for paying a bill

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant user as User
    participant backend as Demo app 
    participant codat as Codat API    
              
    user ->> backend: Select a bill to pay
    backend ->> user: Bill payment view
    user ->> backend: Select account to assign bill payment to
    user ->> backend: Pay bill & submit bill payment

    backend ->> codat: Create bill payment
    codat -->> backend: Push operation
    Note over codat,backend: Poll the push operation endpoint
    loop status != success
        backend ->> codat: Get push operation
        codat ->> backend: Push operation status
    end
    backend ->> backend: Update bill status
    backend ->> user: Bill shown as paid
    
```

:::

The bill remains in a `pending` status during the polling process.

When selecting an account in the **Bill Payment** dialog, the **Account name** dropdown only displays banking accounts in the same currency as the bill. The account type is determined using a query parameter for `isBankAccount=true`. 

The bill payment will be assigned to the selected account in your sandbox QuickBooks Online company.

#### Pay a bill

When you pay a bill, the demo app uses the [Create bill payment](/sync-for-payables-api#/operations/create-bill-payment) endpoint to create the payment in QuickBooks Online for the total amount due. This process reconciles the payment against the outstanding bill.

Here is an example request:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="HTTP" label="HTTP">

#### Request

```http
POST https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/push/billPayments
```
#### Example request body

```json
{
    "supplierRef": {
        "id": "<SUPPLIER_ID>" // ID of the supplier to reconcile payment against
    },
    "accountRef": {
        "id" : "<ACCOUNT_ID>" // ID of the bank account for the payment
    },
    "totalAmount": 2400.00,
    "date": "<ISO_TIMESTAMP>", // date and time of payment
    "currency": "USD",
    "lines": [
      {

        "links": [

            "type": "Bill",
            "id": "<BILL_ID>", // separate link for each bill the bill payment should be reconciled against
            "amount": -2400.00
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## ðŸ’ª Ready for more?

Try these suggestions to make the most of your experience with the demo app:

- **Access sandbox data for a different region**  
  You can set up a sandbox QuickBooks Online company that contains data for a different region, then run through the demo app guide again. For more information, see [Create and test with a sandbox company](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/sandboxes/manage-your-sandboxes) in the Intuit developer documentation.

- **Expand the app's functionality**  
  Go one step further and develop other features that make the Accounts Payable process simpler for your customers. For example, you could provide the ability to pay a bill using a credit note or create a new bill from within your application.
