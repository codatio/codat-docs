## What is it?

**Bill Pay** is the hassle-free way to integrate your [bill](../terms/bill) pay product with your customers' accounting software so you can keep their supplier information, invoices, and payments in sync. 

We designed Bill Pay to handle even the most complex accounts payable workflows with ease, including scenarios that manage credit notes, refunds, partial payments, and bulk payments. Embed it into your application to automate and streamline your customers' [bill](../terms/bill) payments and reconcile them across all major accounting software.

## Who is it for?

We designed and built **Bill Pay** for neobanks, expense management providers, and B2B payment providers. Use this solution kit in your application and automate your customers' bill payments, eliminating duplication of effort, so you can enjoy increased payment volumes as a result.

## How does it work?

With Bill Pay, you can build a solution that covers all the key steps of bill management and payment, catering even to the most complex scenarios. The most common scenario of reading a bill from the accounting software and reflecting a subsequent payment is represented on the diagram.

### [Configure customer](/payables/configure-customer)

Start by creating a [company](../terms/company) to represent your SMB customer in Codat. Then, establish its [connection](/core-concepts/connections) to the customer's accounting software. We will handle the authorization and linking to that platform - all we need is for your SMB to approve this access via our [auth flow](/auth-flow/overview).

### [Get customer's bills](/payables/bills)

Next, let your customer choose the [bills](../terms/bill) - Codat's term for accounts payable invoices - they want to pay. Get a list of their existing unpaid bills and display them in your application, and enable them to create new bills. 

Help your customer manage reference data in preparation to paying these bills: 
* [Display their suppliers](/payables/suppliers) and create new supplier records for them when needed. 
* [Display their bank accounts](/payables/mapping) so they can choose the account to pay bills from and allow them to create a new account when needed.

### [Record payments](/payables/payments)

When your customer completes a bill payment using your application, send the payment details to Codat. We will reflect this transaction in your customer's accounting software and reconcile it against the original bill, handling the complexities and marking it as paid. 

You can then display the updated list of bills to your customer so they can keep track of their spend and outstanding bills through your application.
