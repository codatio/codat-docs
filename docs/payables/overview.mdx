## How does it work?

With Bill Pay, you can build a solution that covers all the key steps of bill
management and payment, catering even to the most complex scenarios. The Bill
Pay process consists of three key steps:

1. **Manage reference data**

   Help your customer manage reference data in preparation to paying their bills
   by displaying their suppliers and creating new supplier records when needed.

2. **Get customer's bills**

   Let your customer choose the bills they want to pay. Get a list of their
   existing unpaid bills and display them in your application, and enable them
   to create new bills.

3. **Record payments**

   When your customer completes a bill payment in your app, send these details
   to Codat. We will reflect this transaction in your customer's accounting
   software and reconcile it against the original bill, marking it as paid.

Bill Pay is designed to integrate a bill pay flow into your app as quickly as possible, focusing on simplicity and efficiency of its endpoints and real-time updates with your SMBs' accounting systems.
