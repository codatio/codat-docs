## How does it work?

With Sync for Payables, you can build a solution that covers all the key steps of bill management and payment, catering even to the most complex scenarios. The most common scenario of pulling a bill from the accounting platform and reflecting a subsequent payment is represented on the diagram.

### [Configure customer](/payables/configure-customer)

Start by creating a [company](../terms/company) to represent your SMB customer in Codat. Then, establish its [connection](/core-concepts/connections) to the customer's accounting platform. We will handle the authorization and linking to that platform - all we need is for your SMB to approve this access via our [auth flow](/auth-flow/overview).

### [Get customer's bills](/payables/bills)

Next, let your customer choose the [bills](../terms/bill) - Codat's term for accounts payable invoices - they want to pay. Get a list of their existing unpaid bills and display them in your application, and enable them to create new bills. 

Help your customer manage reference data in preparation to paying these bills: 
* [Display their suppliers](/payables/suppliers) and create new supplier records for them when needed. 
* [Display their bank accounts](/payables/mapping) so they can choose the account to pay bills from and allow them to create a new account when needed.

### [Record payments](/payables/payments)

When your customer completes a bill payment using your application, send the payment details to Codat. We will reflect this transaction in your customer's accounting platform and reconcile it against the original bill, handling the complexities and marking it as paid. 

You can then display the updated list of bills to your customer so they can keep track of their spend and outstanding bills through your application.
