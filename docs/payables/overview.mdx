## How does it work?

With Bill Pay, you can build a solution that covers all the key steps of bill management and payment, catering even to the most complex scenarios. The Bill Pay process consists of three key steps:

1. **Manage reference data**

    Help your customer manage reference data in preparation to paying their bills by displaying their suppliers and creating new supplier records when needed. 

2. **Get customer's bills**

    Let your customer choose the bills they want to pay. Get a list of their existing unpaid bills and display them in your application, and enable them to create new bills. 

3. **Record payments**

    When your customer completes a bill payment in your app, send these details to Codat. We will reflect this transaction in your customer's accounting software and reconcile it against the original bill, marking it as paid.

We designed two versions of our solution so that you can choose the one that solves the specific needs of your accounting automation use case:
