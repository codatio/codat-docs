By integrating your customers' accounting software, their supplier information, invoices, and payments can be easily kept in sync. 

This automation replaces manual tasks and eliminates duplication of effort, freeing up your customers' time so they can concentrate on running their business.

### How Codat can help

Codat supports B2B payment and invoicing companies, payment providers, and vertical SaaS businesses with their integration requirements by leveraging the [Payables API](/payables-api) product. 

It enables small and medium sized businesses to track and manage their spend with their chosen application and ensure that their financial reports are kept up to date.

### [Connect to your SMB's accounting platform](/auth-flow/overview)

Codat handles authorization and linking to your SMB's accounting platform and takes into account intricate details such as rate limits.

### [Retrieve accounts payable invoices](bills)

A list of unpaid [bills](/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) (accounts payable invoices) can be retrieved from the accounting platform, in the Accounting API a bill is an itemised record of goods purchased from or services provided by a supplier.
Alternatively, Bills can also be created within your application and then synchronised to the accounting platform.

### [Payment account mapping](mapping)

Once Authorised, you can use the bank accounts endpoint to retrieve a list of accounts which can be mapped enabling the user to dictate which account their payments should be reconciled to.

### [Payment reconciliation](payments)

Once the transaction is completed, a bill payment can then be pushed to the customers accounting platform and reconciled against the bill marking it as paid.
