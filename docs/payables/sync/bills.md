:::tip Invoices or bills?

We distinguish between invoices where the company *owes* money and those where the company *is owed* money. 

If the company receives an invoice and owes money as a result, we call this a **bill**.

## Overview

In Codat, a bill represents an *accounts payable* invoice issued to an SMB by their [supplier](../terms/supplier). With Bill Pay, you can:

- Retrieve your customer's existing bills.
- Create new bills in your system and reflect them in your customer's accounting software.  

We have highlighted this alternative sequence of steps in our detailed process diagram below.
