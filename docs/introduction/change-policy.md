We always try to make changes to our product in a backwards-compatible way. This means you can choose whether, when and how to update your code and take advantage of the new functionality.lk';';

## Backwards-compatible changes

The following changes are normally considered as backwards-compatible.
- Any additive changes to the Codat API or front end products, such as:
    - a new datatype or API endpoint
    - a new field within a datatype or API endpoint
    - a new integration
    - a new portal page
    - a new rule
    - a new optional parameter to an API endpoint
- Front end changes that do not materially alter the functionality available or the way that functionality is accessed

See our <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/codat/5-product-roadmap" target="_blank">Product Roadmap</a> to see the new functionality we're planning, working on, or have recently released.

## Breaking changes

Breaking changes are changes that are not possible to make backwards-compatible. When deprecating these, we try to follow the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ParallelChange.html" target="_blank">parallel change pattern</a> (also called the expand and contract pattern).

When planning to make a breaking change, we'll post the details of the upcoming deprecation on our [Important updates](https://codat-docs.vercel.app/updates) at least three months before it is released.  

We'll also send an email to all [developer](https://codat-docs.vercel.app/other/user-management/user-roles) and [administrator](https://codat-docs.vercel.app/other/user-management/user-roles) users in the first week of each calendar quarter (January, April, July, October) with a summary of the upcoming deprecations. 

These users can also choose to enable the deprecations early in the <a href="https://app.codat.io/" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>. 

## Opt-in to changes early

If you'd like to opt-in to a breaking change before its planned implementation date, you can do so in the [Developers section](https://codat-docs.vercel.app/other/portal/developers) of the Codat Portal by navigating to **Developers&nbsp;> API deprecations**. 

Ensure you are familiar with the details of the deprecation you plan to enable and have completed any necessary preparations. 

Only users with [developer](https://codat-docs.vercel.app/other/user-management/user-roles) and [administrator](https://codat-docs.vercel.app/other/user-management/user-roles) roles are able to access the Developers tab and enable the deprecations early.
