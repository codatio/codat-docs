### Data types

Before you start using sync for expenses, you will need to ensure that the following datatypes are enabled in your Codat instance.

## Connect to an SMB’s accounting platform

In Codat, a company represents a business sharing access to their data. Each company can have multiple data connections to different data sources. For example, a business can have one connection to Xero for accounting data and a connection to Plaid for Open banking data.

With Sync for Expenses each company will have two data connections:

- One will be to their accounting platform
- The other will be to the partner expense integration

The partner expense connection is created with the 'Linked' status, so you won't need to authorize this connection again. 

## Enable your SMB to authorize access to their data

Before you can push expenses to your customer’s accounting platform, you need to get access to it. There are three ways you can enable your customers to grant access to their financial accounts:

1.  **Embedded Link:** Codat's Embedded Link is a React component that neatly sits in your front-end code, and can be deployed in a matter of minutes (see [embedded link](/auth-flow/authorize-embedded-link)).

2.  **Hosted Link**: a beautifully simple, pre-built, conversion-optimized, and customizable authentication flow (See [Authorize with Hosted Link](/auth-flow/authorize-hosted-link)).

3.  **Build your own SMB authentication flow** for a fully customized bespoke user journey (See [Build your own auth flow](/auth-flow/build/build-your-own-authorization-journey)).

### Create a data connection

Once your customer has authorized access to their accounting platform, you will need to create a connection against the company for the partner expense integration.
