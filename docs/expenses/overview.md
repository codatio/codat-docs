## How does it work?

With Sync for Expenses, you can build a solution that covers all the key steps of expense management.

### [Configure customer](/expenses/configure-customer)

Start by creating a [company](../terms/company) to represent your SMB customer in Codat. Then, establish its [connection](/core-concepts/connections) to the customer's accounting software. We will handle the authorization and linking to that platform - all we need is for your SMB to approve this access via our [auth flow](/auth-flow/overview).

### [Map customer transactions](/expenses/config-and-categorize)

Create expense configuration for your customer's company so that Sync for Expenses can attribute their spend to the correct accounts, suppliers, and customers. 

Expenses can also be categorized according to your SMB's bookkeeping. Provide your customer with the opportunity to choose the accounts, tracking categories, and tax rates that their expenses will be mapped to. 

### [Create and update transactions](/expenses/sync-process/expense-transactions)

Once the customer has categorized their expenses using the mapping options, use Sync for Expenses to push their everyday purchases to the SMB's accounting software. Sync for Expenses also enables SMB customers to push attachments for a complete audit trail.

You can also create [transfers](/expenses/sync-process/transfer-transactions) and [reimbursements](/expenses/sync-process/reimbursable-expense-transactions).

### [Sync expense transactions](/expenses/sync-process/syncing-expenses)

Once you create a categorized expense transaction, we automatically initiate a sync of these transactions. The sync processes the expenses you created, maps them into the format required by the accounting software, and records them in that platform. 

### [Upload attachments](/expenses/sync-process/uploading-receipts)

When creating an expense transaction, allow your SMB customer to save a copy of the associated receipt in their accounting software.
