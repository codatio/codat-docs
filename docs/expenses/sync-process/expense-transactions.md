description: Create expense-transaction datasets to represent your customers spend
---

An [expense transaction](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-expense-dataset) represents the context behind the purchase.

It can include details about the purchase from the mapping options, for example:

- The type of transaction, e.g. a payment or refund

- Which account in the general ledger the transaction should be reconciled to `accountRef`

- The associated tax rates `taxRateRef`

- Any applicable tracking categories `trackingRefs`

When pushing expenses, use your transaction `id` so that it can serve as an idempotency key. Codat validates `id`'s to ensure that every `id` is unique to a company. 
This approach prevents duplicate transactions being created in your SMBs' accounting software.

## Transaction types

The way Codat handles, maps and processes a transaction is based on the specified `type` of the transaction.
