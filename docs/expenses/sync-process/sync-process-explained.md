### [Create expense-transactions datasets](expense-transactions)

After the company has categorized their expenses using the mapping options, you can create expense-transaction datasets, in the response you will receive a `datasetId`.

```http title="Create expense dataset"
POST https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/sync/expenses/expense-transactions
```

### [Initiate sync](syncing-expenses)

You can then initiate the sync process for multiple datasets by making an API request to the [sync endpoint](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/intiate-sync).

```http title="Initiate a sync of expense datasets"
POST  https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/sync/expenses/syncs
```
A `syncId` will be returned to the response payload.

You can initiate multiple syncs at once. Codat will manage the queueing of these syncs and push the data to the accounting platform.

### Check sync status

There are three ways to check the status of the sync:

1.  Using webhooks and the `sync completed` rule

2.  Polling the [sync status endpoint](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/get-sync-by-id)

3.  Using the Sync Health Site for Sync for Expenses

### Check transactions

Once the sync has completed, you should check whether the transactions were successfully synced to the accounting package. This can be done via the [transaction metadata endpoint](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/get-sync-transactions)

```http title="Transaction status"
GET https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/sync/expenses/syncs/{syncId}/transactions
```

### [Upload Receipts](uploading-receipts)

To post the attachment for each `transactionId` with a status of `Completed` and integrationType of `expense`, call the [attachment endpoint](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/upload-attachment)

```http title="Upload receipt"
POST https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/sync/expenses/syncs/{syncId}/transactions/{transactionId}/attachments
```
