## Upload attachments

When creating an expense or transfers transaction, your SMB customer may want to save a copy of the associated receipt in their accounting software. 

Use the [Upload attachment](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/upload-expense-attachment) endpoint to attach one or multiple files to the transaction, relating them via its `transactionId`. The endpoint accepts attachments as multipart form data and writes them synchronously.

```http
POST https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/sync/expenses/syncs/{syncId}/transactions/{transactionId}/attachments
```

```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=yourBoundaryString

--yourBoundaryString
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="yourFileMetaData"

{ "includeWhenSent": false }

--yourBoundaryString
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="yourFileData"; filename="TEST_SEND_FILE.txt"

--yourBoundaryString--
```

#### Attach a receipt using Postman

If you are using Postman to attach files, there are additional steps you need to complete. 

Perform a `POST` request to the [Upload attachment](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/upload-expense-attachment) endpoint (review our example [here](https://postman.codat.io/#f3b78b32-f1a7-4016-b222-fd26efdcc126)):

```http
POST https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/sync/expenses/syncs/{syncId}/transactions/{transactionId}/attachments
```
1.  In the request setup, select **Body**, then **form-data**.

2.  Click in the first **KEY** row, then select **File** from the **File** list.

3.  In the corresponding **VALUE** field, click **Select Files** and choose the file you wish to attach.

4.  Manually type the file name and extension in the **KEY** field.

5.  Press **Send** to make the request.

## Update attachments

If your user wants to update any of the attached documents, they should delete the existing attachment directly in the accounting software first. 

Then, they can attach the correct document using the [Upload attachment](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/upload-expense-attachment) endpoint.

Alternatively, the user can upload the correct file directly to the accounting software.
