## Overview

When implementing your Expenses solution, you need to create your SMB customer as a [company](../terms/company) in Codat before registering their accounting software as a connection. You can do that when the customer starts interacting with your application.  

Next, you will connect the company to a data source via one of our integrations. With Expenses, each company will have two data connections: one to the SMB's accounting software, and another one - to the partner expense integration, i.e. your application.

## Create a company

Within Expenses, a company represents your SMB customer that manages their expenses using your application. To create it, use our [Create company](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-company) endpoint. It returns a JSON response containing the company `id`. You will use this `id` to establish a connection to an accounting software.

## Create accounting connection

Next, use the [Create connection](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-connection) endpoint to connect the company to an accounting data source via one of our integrations. This will allow you to synchronize data with that source. In the request body, specify a `platformKey` of the accounting software you're looking to connect.

| Accounting software | platformKey |
| ---  | ---  |
| Dynamics 365 Business Central | `trji` |
| FreeAgent | `fbrh` |
| Oracle NetSuite | `akxx` |
| QuickBooks Desktop | `pqsw`|
| QuickBooks Online | `qhyg` |
| Xero | `gbol` |

As an example, let's create a QuickBooks Online (QBO) connection. In response, the endpoint returns a `dataConnection` object with a `PendingAuth` status and a `linkUrl`. Direct your customer to the `linkUrl` to initiate our [Link auth flow](/auth-flow/overview) and enable them to authorize this connection.

## Create partner expense connection

Once your customer has authorized access to their accounting software, you need to create another connection for their company for the partner expense integration. 

Use our [Create partner expense connection](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-partner-expense-connection) to link the company to your application. This connection is created with the `Linked` status, so you don't need to do anything else to authorize it.

## Deauthorize a connection

If your customer wants to revoke their approval and sever the connection to their accounting software, use the [Unlink connection](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/unlink-connection) endpoint.

You can [learn more](/auth-flow/optimize/connection-management) about connection management best practices and see how you can provide this functionality in your app's UI.

```json
PATCH /companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}
 {
 "status": "Unlinked"
 }
```

:::tip Recap

You have created the structure of key objects required by Codat's Expenses: a company and its connections to an accounting data source and your partner expense integration.

Next, learn how to configure the company to associate the expenses with correct accounts, suppliers, and customers and enable your customers to indicate their preferred expense mapping options.
