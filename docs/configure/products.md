## Enabling products

When signing up for a Codat account, you'll have to select and enable a product you're interested in using (you can always enable other products later). 

Enabling a product will configure the portal and your new client for use of this product, including the default data type settings.

You can manage your enabled products in [the portal](https://app.codat.io/settings/products) (users with Administrator roles only). Currently, you cannot disable products - please contact support if you need help with this.
