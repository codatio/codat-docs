## Setting up integrations

You can enable the integrations you need [via the Portal](https://app.codat.io/settings). Each integration configuration page shows how to set up that integration, including links to external documentation and the integration's developer portal.

See our detailed integration-specific [documentation](/integrations/all-integrations) for more information about the integrations you need.
