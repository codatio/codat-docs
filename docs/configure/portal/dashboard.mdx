## The Portal

Most configuration of your Codat solution happens via the Portal, and you can do all of the above through the settings pages. You can use the navigation bar to access these sections of the Portal. Some tabs and pages (for example, the [Developers](/configure/portal/developers) tab) are only available to specific [user roles](/configure/user-management/user-roles).

### Settings

This is where the bulk of your configuration occurs. There are 4 main settings areas:

- Auth flow - Settings relating to your authorization flow, whether your using embedded & hosted link, or your own solution
- Webhooks - Configure webhook consumers and check available event types
- Integrations - Enable and configure integrations, and manage the data you're retrieve from them
- Organization - [Invite users](/configure/user-management/adding-users) and manage their roles

### Developers

Manage your API keys, and see developer-specific resources.
