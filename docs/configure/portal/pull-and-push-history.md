Similar functionality is available for [read history](/using-the-api/pull-history).

## Via API

Coming soon!

## In the Portal

When viewing a company in the Portal, you can view **Read history** and **Write history** to check the status of previous read and write data syncs by data type.

`Companies > Company > Data history > Write history`

When a write operation of data is initialized, items will appear here for each data type being written.

- Type - data type name, with integration name below
- Write operation ID - the ID of the write operation for that data type
- Requested date
- Time to complete
- Status
