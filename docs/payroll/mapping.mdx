In order for your customers to be able to represent their payroll costs
appropriately in their accounting software, they will first need to do some
initial configuration.

Typically each company will want to set:

- Which bank account payments are made from
- Which expense account each payroll component corresponds with
- Any additional mapping for things like departments and locations

SMB Has accounting software

Client Has payroll components list Has departments, locations,

## Select the account payroll payments will be made from

The payment account is a bank account from which payroll payments can be
dispersed from to employees bank accounts.

A list of the available options in the company's accounting software can be
retrieved from the
[bankAccounts](/sync-for-payroll-api#/operations/list-accounts) endpoint:

```http request title="List bank accounts"
GET https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/data/accounts?query=isBankAccount%3dtrue
```

## Map payroll components to relevant accounts

Each company will have different preferences for how they want to record their
employees payroll costs, pensions, and taxes against various nominal accounts.

You will have in your system some list of _payroll components_ that constitute
the different parts of a company's payroll. For example:

```
const payrollComponents = [
  {
    id: "9017ab32-5d56-41a2-b46f-40b62f7677b7",
    name: "Performance bonuses"
    category: "Bonuses",
  },
  {
    id: "248f6da7-c9e2-48fd-b304-ca20216a5d01",
    name: "Pensions"
    category: "Benefits",
  },
  ...
]
```

You should provide your customer with a flexible interface to enable companies
to handle the nuances of how they want to reconcile their data. Mapping could be
as complex or granular as suits your usecase.

### Get the accounts

You can use the
[chartOfAccounts](/sync-for-payroll-api#/operations/list-accounts) to populate
this interface with the `name` representing what the account is called in their
accounting software.

```http request title="List accounts"
GET https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/data/accounts?page=1&pageSize=100
```

Query parameters can also be used to narrow the list of accounts you want to
retrieve:

- `status=Active` returns only active accounts
- `type=Expense` returns accounts that are used for recording as business
  expenses

### Map accounts

You'll need to build an interface that lists all the payroll components of your
system, and allows the user to set which account in their accounting software it
corresponds to.

For example:

<Payroll />

## Map tracking categories

Businesses may want additional categorization for their payroll expenses. For
example they might want to group it by department (e.g. sales and marketing) or
location.

You will have in your system some list of the additional things you want to
track. For example:

```
const categories = [
  {
    id: "77187e56-fdc0-4d0e-92d4-6189392874eb",
    name: "Department - Sales"
  },
  {
    id: "248f6da7-c9e2-48fd-b304-ca20216a5d01",
    name: "Department - Marketing"
  },
  {
    id: "25664661-ad12-452c-8c2a-13ee029f7322",
    name: "Location - US"
  },
  {
    id: "2756a658-e17b-408a-b9ba-4d3ad56342bd",
    name: "Location - UK"
  },
  ...
]
```

[Tracking categories](/sync-for-payroll-api#/operations/list-tracking-categories)
can be used to retrieve departments, locations and projects for each company.

```http request title="List tracking categories"
GET https://api.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/data/trackingCategories?page=1&pageSize=100
```
