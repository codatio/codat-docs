Use Codat to integrate your customers' payroll data from their HR and payroll platforms into their accounting platforms and to support its reconciliation.

### How Codat can help

We can support HR and payroll software software companies and vertical SaaS companies in their activity by leveraging our [Sync for Payroll API](/sync-for-payroll-api) product in response to customers' requests for accounting integrations. 

Integrating with Codat helps your SMB customers remove complexity and repetition from payroll processing, eliminate manual entry and mapping of payroll data, and save time on tasks that usually need to be completed multiple times a month.

#### Sync for Payroll API

We have done the heavy lifting for you by building integrations with a standardized data model to the accounting platforms your customers already use. This gives you access to real-time data that you can pull, create, or update to support your use case.

Each business may need to reconcile payroll costs, pensions, and taxes to different nominal accounts, based on their business type and the accounting platform they use. Codat provides an endpoint to pull chart of accounts and tracking categories data in order to avoid manual categorization efforts and give flexibility to SMBs for reconciling data. As a payroll platform, you will need to build a flexible interface for your customer to perform the mapping.  

Then, use our create / update functionality to post a journal that shows correct amounts against each account. These transactions can easily be reconciled against the business's bank feed.
