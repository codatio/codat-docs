## Generate payroll object

Before you can record the payroll in the accounting software, you'll need to
generate a line item object for each employee for each corresponding payroll
component. That means you'll likely have multiple line items for each employee.

Each line item object should have the following information:

- `description` - a title such as the month of the payroll or payrun
- `accountRef` - The corresponding account
- `netAmount` - Net amount paid to employee
- `currency` - The currency corresponding to the amount
- `tracking` - A list of references to records for tracking

## Record payroll

Steps:

- [Get Journal push model](sync-payroll#get-journal-push-model)
- [Creating a payroll entry](sync-payroll#creating-a-payroll-entry)
- [Monitoring the status of the request](sync-payroll#monitoring-the-status-of-the-request)

    app ->> codat: Creat journalEntry to represent payroll
    codat -->> app: pushOperation key

    codat -->> app: pushOperation status webhook

    app ->> codat: retrieve pushOperation detail

```

In order to record payroll entries in the accounting software, you can use the
[create journal entries](/sync-for-payroll-api#/operations/create-journal-entry)
endpoint to push payroll to the mapped accounts on the SMB's general ledger.

The journal entry can then be reconciled against the debit entry in the
companies bankfeeds.

### Get Journal push model

Before creating a journalEntry - you should first check the datamodel, This
helps you ensure all required properties are included in your request.

Checking the model may be a one-time activity (for integrations with static
properties) or be required more frequently (for ERP integrations with higher
customization options).

Let's use our Get create journalEntries model endpoint to view
integration-specific requirements for creating the journalEntries data type in
Xero.

The response indicates that the following properties must be populated
(`required: true`) when you create a journalEntry to represent payroll in Xero:

- `postedOn`
- `journalLines` which also require the following sub properties
  - `description`
  - `netAmount`
  - `accountRef`
  - `tracking`

### Creating a payroll entry

:::caution Properties not in the _Get model_ response If you attempt to create
or update a record using properties not documented in the _Get journalEntries
model_ response, you may receive validation errors in response to your request.
:::

When creating the payroll Journal Entry, you should create a line item for each
payroll component, and the sum of the amounts on the payroll component should be
equal to the sum of the debit on the mapped bank account that the payment is
being made from.

in the example below, there are five journalEntry line's:

1. The first line credits(increases the balance) of the "Payroll Wage Expenses"
   by $7,291.67
1. The second line credits the "Payroll Tax Payable" account by $452.08
1. The third line credits the "Payroll Expenses 401k" account by $1166.67
1. The fourth line debits(reduces the balance) the "Checking" account by
   $8,910.42, the debit against the bank account should equal the sum of the
   payroll components.

When you make the request, you will receive a pushOperation response, this will
include the following information:

- **pushOperationKey**: a unique idempotent identifier generated by Codat to
  represent this single pushOperation that can be used to track its status
- **dataType**: the type of data being created, in this case, `journalEntry`
- **status**: the status of the create operation, which can be `Pending`,
  `Failed`, `Success` or `TimedOut`
- **requestedOnUtc**: the datetime (in UTC) when the operation was requested
- **completedOnUtc**: the datetime (in UTC) when the operation was completed,
  null if `Pending`
- **validation**: a human-readable object that contains validation details,
  including errors, encountered during the operation.
- **changes**: an array that communicates which record has changed (`recordRef`
  property) and the manner in which it changed (`type` property that can be
  `Unknown`, `Created`, `Modified`, or `Deleted`)

### Monitoring the status of the request

After your request has been accepted, it will have a status of `Pending`. You
should use the
[PushOperationStatusChanged](../using-the-api/webhooks/event-types) event type
to track when the status of your pushOperation changes to `Success` or `Failed`.

If you want to see a history of all pushOperations for your company, you can
retrieve these from the
[list-push-operations](/sync-for-payroll-api#/operations/list-push-operations)
endpoint.
