Linking data
What is authorisation?

The authorisation process is the mechanism by which your SME customers share their financial data with you by linking their data. Once a company has linked its accounting, banking, or commerce data, you can use that data to improve your business.

Linking data with you provides benefits for both the SME linking its data and for you as a lender. This guide outlines suggestions and tips to maximise the number of companies which share their data with you, and thereby maximises the benefit to you and your customers.

Importance of maximising links

Enables easy and continuous access to financial data, which:

saves you time and money
reduces your risk through access to real-time data
allows you to prioritise which companies need attention now
improves the experience for your customers
increases your sales/throughput and grants overall competitive advantage
Value exchange

The fundamental value exchange of the link process is that a business shares financial data with you to receive the best services available for their specific needs. The value exchange is formed of benefits to you as a lender, and to your customer.

Benefit to you as a lender:
Access to financial data allows you to understand the position of your customers
Data is available in the Codat UI, via API, or Excel download instead of manual emails or PDFs
Data is in a standard format from numerous sources, allowing for ease of understanding
Benefits to your customer benefit you as well
Benefit to your customer:
Customers will receive better services because you understand their position in more detail
Simple linking user journey eliminates the need to manually create reports and upload or email them
Required data is gathered all at once, reducing the need for asking for more data
Maximising links

Maximising the number of companies who choose to link their data to maximise the benefits you receive from Codat. There are a number of things you can do to maximise the number of companies who link.

User journey considerations

Embedding the link flow into your own application journey has enabled more links than manual approaches across Codats clients to date. Bearing this in mind, guidelines for Codat Portal and for API implementation are below.

API

The API implementation of the link flow involves you building your own linking journey powered by the Codat API. Tips to maximise links:

Consent flows built into your own application journey and in-keeping with your branding are more effective
The journey should be as short as possible without compromising on other factors
The Codat no-code solution allows a business to link in 6 clicks
Set the expectation of the time required upfront – a business is more likely to link if they know the process only takes one minute
The journey should be intuitive and prompt the user to the next step each time
Consider surfacing the ability to remove connections in your flow
Consider adding an FAQ section about sharing data as part of your flow
Place the option to link financial data close to the point of the business understanding that they need your product
For example, a bank account showing an overdraft shows an offer for a longer-term financing solution for the business by sharing financial data
Note: some businesses do not want to see unsolicited offers
Simplify flows through visual elements such as icons
Portal

The portal implementation of the link flow involves you manually sending the link URL to the business. Tips to maximise links:

Identify target groups and send the general Codat Intro Link to all customers or prospects in that group
Make it clear that the business can revoke consent at any point in their accounting platform
Consider embedding the auth flow in your application journey
Messaging considerations

Whatever the method of implementation, customers will want to understand what they are doing when they share data through the link process and the benefits of doing so. Messaging around the link flow is an important factor in maximising links. Customers are more likely to link their data if you:

Explain what the purpose of sharing data is and how the data will be used
Outline whether sharing data via the link flow is mandatory or optional
Explain the necessity of the data to the specific product or service being considered
We advise making this a mandatory step, although A/B testing is also recommended to ensure it does not affect your pipeline
Explain who will have access to the data and how you will keep it secure
Explain how they can revoke consent or change their mind
Value exchange and incentives

A business is more likely to share their data if they have a tangible incentive. Financial incentives are by far the most effective. An incentive can also take the form of the customer understanding the benefits they receive. Suggestions to address this perspective:

Identify the driver for the particular application
For a need for the money in desperate times - the value exchange can be quicker processing and shorter time to cash
For a need for the money for a new opportunity - longer processing times using manual methods can result in a missed opportunity and the competition potentially moving in
For revolving facilities (such as invoice financing) - removing manual processes can ensure they get the funds on time every period, eliminating the risk of forgotten submissions for a given period
Covenants - remove the risk of them missing the auditing period/covenant monitoring submission period. Missing reporting period can result in the business defaulting on their agreement and could result in negative consequences such as limited access to further funding, credit score impact
Quantifiable time saving: a manual process can take you a few hours every month, and the link process saves you this time
Offer more bespoke services to customers that use the link process
Sharing financial data manually will not be the norm in years to come – let the customer know they are getting ahead of the curve
At the first point of engagement, data is manually extracted in the format that it is required which means they don’t have to download from different systems and format, they can spend time focused on their business and making that successful.
Better rates - if you save money from the initial onboarding/ongoing servicing/reduction in bad debts, can you pass some of that benefit on to the customer?
The link process enables small businesses to be serviced at competitive rates; using manual processes this segment is not profitable to service
Consider using Codat’s push functionality to input lending transactions into the accounting platform on their behalf, reducing the manual work for your customer even further
Suggested language

Two examples of messaging to build into your flow or share with your clients:

Example 1

We are looking to improve security around data sharing by leveraging the strict consent mechanisms used by accounting platform providers. You will be asked to login and connect your accounting platform, to securely share the requested financial information required for your application and on-going monitoring of your credit facility.

This means you will be explicitly giving consent to share your financial data with us only, and this connection can be removed at any time, should you choose. And don't worry – your data is encrypted and protected in line with modern safety standards.

Example 2

Our integrations aim to simplify your experience:

We retrieve your latest balance sheets and profit and loss statement – so you don’t need to provide any information manually.

We update data automatically to ensure we keep pace with your business and ask you no unnecessary questions, saving you time.
