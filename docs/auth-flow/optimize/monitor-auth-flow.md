We equip you with tools to monitor your auth flow. In the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/monitor/auth-flow-overview), you can see where your customers are struggling and optimize the flow where necessary. This monitoring is performed across all enabled integration categories.

[Navigate](https://app.codat.io/monitor/auth-flow-overview) to **Monitor > Auth flow > Overview** to discover the overall **percentage** of your customers that have authorized the integration connections and the overall percentage of companies that uploaded a file as part of their auth process. 

### Auth funnel

Analyze the **auth funnel** to see how many customers completed their authorization journey in contrast to the quantity of those who started the Link flow and those who began the auth process. 

:::info Optional steps

If an integration category is marked as optional in **Settings > Auth flow > Link**, skipping that step increases the auth success measure of the funnel.

:::info Using your own auth flow?

If you've built your own solution, the **Began flow** step will be backfilled 
:::

### Completion rate over time

Visualize your stats of auth flow completion using the **graph**. It represents the ratio of the number of completed auth journeys to the number of started auth flows within a given week, expressed as a percentage. 

:::caution Not seeing any data?

Monitoring only begins once your first customer successfully authorizes. As a result, initial days of use may not appear on the conversion chart if no journeys have been completed.
