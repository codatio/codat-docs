Transparency leads to trust. Trust leads to consent. Consent results in your customers getting value from their connected data.

Let your SMB customers understand what will happen with their connected data. Offer further support via various channels.

:::success Why this matters

It is imperative your customers trust you with their data, otherwise they may not consent to connecting their accounts.
:::

- Specify the data being shared and what will happen to it
- Communicate to build trust with your customers
- Require an action to consent to data sharing
- Let the user know they can disconnect at any time
- Link to a connection guide
- Use statistical data to reinforce trust
- Provide various support contact details
- Show that your authorization flow is powered by Codat
- Bonus: Offer a mutual non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

## Specify the data being shared and what will happen to it

Be transparent about the customer's data that you'll be using:

- Specify the integration category (e.g.., accounting data)
- Specify which data will be used and the direction of data travel (from or to the connected platform)

## Communicate to build trust with your customers

- Reinforce user trust with your choice of language: “_Securely_ add your revenue streams”
- Reassure your customer that their data will never be shared with third parties without consent
- Clearly state what is required to authorize and withdraw consent

## Require an action to consent to data sharing

To confirm a user's consent to sharing data, you can require that they click a checkbox against a data privacy policy link before your flow allows them to connect. This draws attention to the level of importance you attribute to your customer’s data.

Consider this example: _“Your data is safe with [your company name]. As per our Terms of Use, all information shared is protected by a strict non-disclosure policy. We do not share data with third parties. I understand that my data is protected by a strict non-disclosure policy✔️. ”_

## Let the user know they can disconnect at any time

The customer should be able to change their mind about connecting at a later date. This recommendation still applies to use cases that only require a one-time connection, as that may not be clear to a customer.

## Link to a connection guide

Link to a detailed set of instructions and FAQs that include connection guidance rather than a privacy policy directly. On top of providing extra clarity, they should further explain the value of connecting accounts.

:::caution

Make sure you link to your own privacy policy and/or instructions and not Codat’s.
:::

## Use statistical data to reinforce trust

Hard facts are a great way to bolster your value statements. Consider this example: _"Over 40,000 customers trust our encryption."_

## Provide various support contact details

The most successful implementations can offer a direct phone number, support e-mail, and submit a support request, at any stage of the flow.

## Show that your authorization flow is powered by Codat

Codat is widely recognized for following a high standard of data protection. Adding a "Powered by Codat" logo to your authorization flow will instantly boost your customer's trust.

If you use Link, you can [enable the logo via Link settings](/auth-flow/customize/customize-link#configure-your-link-flow).

If you are building your own authorization flow, you can embed the logo into your app by following the instructions [here](/auth-flow/build/build-your-own-authorization-journey#bonus-show-that-your-authentication-flow-is-powered-by-codat).

## ⭐ Offer a mutual non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

Mutual NDA agreements can be a very powerful tool to build trust with your customer.

For example:  
_“Through the wonders of API integration, we can instantly underwrite [customer company name]'s finances. Connecting more accounts will allow us to provide a lower rate to you. The MNDA agreement ensures that your data will be safe with us.”_
