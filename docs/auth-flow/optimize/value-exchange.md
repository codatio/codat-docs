title: "Value exchange"
description: "Communicate the benefits customers can receive from connecting their data"

The value exchange is maybe the single most important part of your implementation. It intercepts your customer at their decision point, explaining why they would benefit from connecting their accounts.

Simply requiring the data to be connected for a certain feature of your product to function is not good enough. You must build trust and promote the benefit of connected data.

- Include the 3-part value exchange
- Embed CTAs that drive users to connect at advantageous points in your app
- Link out to FAQs
- Bonus: gamify the connection process by using a progress or strength meter

:::success Why this matters

You may see **up to 50%** of visitors deciding to connect, with conversion increasing month-on-month with a well-executed value exchange.

## Include the 3-part value exchange

The 3-part value exchange should be brief but informative and include:

- The value received by the customer
- How the data will be utilized
- What the customer must do next.

1. Explain to the customer what value they can receive from connecting their data. For example:
   "_To use [name of your product/product feature], we need to collect some information about your company’s financial health and assess your levels of risk. Your data is never shared with 3rd parties._"
2. Tell your customer how you will be using their data
   See these examples for an underwriting use case:

**Commerce integrations**: Connecting this [Commerce integration] allows us to automatically identify your recurring revenue and synchronize it with [your product].

**Banking integrations**: Connecting this [banking integration] allows us to compare the validity and completeness of your accounting data as well as calculate your estimated burn rate and runway.

**Accounting integrations**: Connecting this [accounting integration] allows us to evaluate your financial health and determine the risk score.

3. Tell your customer what they should do next
   Make sure the main call to action (CTA) is clear, for example: "_Connect your [insert data source type i.e. 'accounting software']_".

## Embed CTAs that drive users to connect at advantageous points in your app

Embed CTAs within your app where your customer will get value from connecting. For example, prompt them to connect to populate a business insights chart.

## Link out to FAQs

Further educate your users on the benefits of connecting their accounts by linking out to FAQs from your application, for example: “_Want to know more?_”.

## ⭐ Gamify the connection process by using a progress or strength meter

Keep users engaged by showing them the progress of their connection. Does your solution require multiple types of data to be connected (e.g., a loan application)? Motivate SMBs to connect more sources of data by increasing the "strength" of their application with every connected integration.
