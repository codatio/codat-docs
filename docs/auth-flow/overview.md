Authorization is a key part of any solution built with Codat. Each of your SMB customers must authorize access to their data before you can use that data. A frictionless and reassuring auth flow is essential for receiving the authorization from your SMB customers.

To achieve this, use our [Link SDK component](/auth-flow/authorize-embedded-link) and embed our Link auth flow in your application.

## Supported products

Link is compatible with our entire [product range](/using-the-api/overview#apis) except [Sync for Commerce](/commerce/overview). To set up your Sync for Commerce authorization flow, follow the instructions in our [dedicated documentation](/commerce/overview).

## Supported integrations

Browser and mobile compatibility of Link varies for different integrations:

  - Some integrations are **desktop-only**, e.g. [Sage 50](/integrations/accounting/sage50/accounting-sage50), [QuickBooks Desktop](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/accounting-quickbooksdesktop).
  - Others require **downloading a desktop package**, e.g. [Oracle NetSuite](/integrations/accounting/netsuite/accounting-netsuite), [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](/integrations/accounting/dynamics365businesscentral/accounting-dynamics365businesscentral).
  - Other integrations require switching to complex flows on **non mobile-optimized websites** due to the complexity of the third-party platform, e.g. [Sage 200cloud](/integrations/accounting/sage200/accounting-sage200), [Sage Intacct](/integrations/accounting/sage-intacct/accounting-sage-intacct).

:::tip Change management

As with all Codat products, Link SDK is subject to [our change management policy](/using-the-api/change-policy). We will give appropriate notice for changes to our auth flow UI and any associated APIs. We have rigorous testing and security measures in place to ensure you can import our SDK with confidence.

We also provide updates in our [SDK changelog](/auth-flow/authorize-embedded-link#changelog).
