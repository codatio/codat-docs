Authorization is a key part of any solution built with Codat. Each of your SMB customers must authorize access to their data before you can use that data. A frictionless and reassuring auth flow is essential for receiving the authorization from your SMB customers.

To achieve this, use our [Link SDK component](/auth-flow/authorize-embedded-link) and embed our Link auth flow in your application.

## Supported products and integrations

Link is compatible with our entire [product range](/using-the-api/overview#apis) except [Sync for Commerce](/commerce/overview). To set up your Sync for Commerce authorization flow, follow the instructions in our [dedicated documentation](/commerce/overview).

Browser and mobile compatibility of Link varies for different integrations:

  - Some integrations are **desktop-only**, e.g. [Sage 50](/integrations/accounting/sage50/accounting-sage50), [QuickBooks Desktop](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/accounting-quickbooksdesktop).
  - Others require **downloading a desktop package**, e.g. [Oracle NetSuite](/integrations/accounting/netsuite/accounting-netsuite), [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](/integrations/accounting/dynamics365businesscentral/accounting-dynamics365businesscentral).
  - Other integrations require switching to complex flows on **non mobile-optimized websites** due to the complexity of the third-party platform, e.g. [Sage 200cloud](/integrations/accounting/sage200/accounting-sage200), [Sage Intacct](/integrations/accounting/sage-intacct/accounting-sage-intacct).
