When a customer links their company data, OpenID Connect lets you retrieve [standard information](/auth-flow/customize/use-openid-connect#openid-connect-fields) from the user profile of their accounting software, such as the customer's name, email address, and phone number. You might use these details to:

- Pre-fill an application form for the customer.
- Identify accounts linked by the same person.

This article explains how to configure your authorization process to use OpenID Connect.

:::info Support for OpenID Connect

- Codat's linking process can only return available profile details, which vary from platform to platform. Codat currently supports OpenID Connect for QuickBooks Online, Xero, and our testing sandbox. See [_OpenID Connect Supported fields_](/auth-flow/customize/use-openid-connect#openid-connect-fields) for the specific fields supported for each platform.
- Codat doesn't use OpenID Connect to either verify the identity of customers, or to authorize data sharing or connections.

## Configure your authorization process

Update your redirect URL and Hosted Link URLs.

1. Add any parameters that you require from the user profile to your [redirect URL](/auth-flow/customize/set-up-redirects). For example:
   ```http
   https://redirect.com/site/{companyId}?firstName={openId_given_name}&email={openId_email}&phone={openId_phone_number}
   ```
2. Append `?openId=true` to a Link URL before you send it to a customer. For example:
   ```http
   https://link-uat.codat.io/{companyId}/link?openId=true
   ```

   When the customer connects their accounting software any available profile values are substituted in the redirect URL. For example:
   ```http
   https://redirect.com/site /{companyId}?firstName=John&email=john.smith@theworld.com&phone+441234555666
   ```

Codat supports a subset of the available [OpenID Connect fields](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims), or claims, for selected integrations. Codat prepends each field name with `openId_` to avoid conflict with existing fields.
