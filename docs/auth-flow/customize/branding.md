## Overview

Link is a white-labelled solution that can be matched to your company's branding. Go to **[Settings > Auth flow > Branding](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding)** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) to tailor Link for a fully custom-branded experience.

The branding settings page autosaves when changes are made. You can adjust the following UI elements:

### Company name

Your company name, as you see it in the Portal, is also displayed in Link when your customers connect their accounting platforms to Codat.

### Company logo

This logo appears in the navigation bar of Link, and on the on-premise connector screens when users link on-premise applications (e.g. Sage 50 and QuickBooks Desktop).

Use PNG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF file formats and ensure the file size does not exceed 10MB. Recommended dimensions for the company logo are 600px x 100px.

### Company icon

This icon (uploaded as a favicon) appears as the Link browser tab icon and on the on-premise connectors' system tray icon when an on-premise application is running in the background on a customer's computer.

Use ICO file format and ensure the file size does not exceed 500KB. Recommended dimensions for the company icon are 32px x 32px.

### Primary color

You can set your brand's primary color to define the color of buttons and other elements within Link and Sync Flow. We recommend using a dark primary color, because light colors may cause accessibility issues.

:::tip Sync flow

This primary color setting also applies to the Sync flow, a journey specific to our [Sync for Commerce](/commerce/overview) product.
