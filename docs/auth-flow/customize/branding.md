## Overview

Link is a white-labelled solution that can be matched to your company's branding. Go to **[Settings > Auth flow > Branding](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding)** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) to tailor Link for a fully custom-branded experience.

The branding settings page autosaves when changes are made. You can adjust the following UI elements:

### Company name

Your company name, as you see it in the Portal, is also displayed in Link when your customers connect their accounting software to Codat.

### Company logo

This logo appears in the navigation bar of Link, and on the on-premise connector screens when users link on-premise applications (e.g. Sage 50 and QuickBooks Desktop).

Logo requirements:

- Use PNG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF file formats.
- Files should not exceed 10MB.
- Recommended dimensions: 600px x 100px.

### Company icon

This icon (uploaded as a favicon) appears as the Link browser tab icon and on the on-premise connectors' system tray icon when an on-premise application is running in the background on a customer's computer.

Icon requirements:

- Use ICO file format.
- Files should not exceed 500KB.
- Recommended dimensions: 32px x 32px.

### Primary color

You can set your brand's primary color to define the color of buttons and other elements within the Link Flow. We recommend using a dark primary color, because light colors may cause accessibility issues.
