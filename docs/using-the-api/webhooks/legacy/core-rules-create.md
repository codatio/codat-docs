:::caution New webhook service available

This page describes the functionality of our legacy webhook offering. [Learn more](/using-the-api/webhooks/overview) about our new webhook service and see how you can [migrate](/using-the-api/webhooks/migration-guide) to use it instead.

:::

:::info Required permissions

You'll need to be an [Administrator](/configure/user-management/user-roles#administrator) or [Developer](/configure/user-management/user-roles#developer) user to create rules. [Analyst](/configure/user-management/user-roles#analyst) users can view events but not create or modify rules.

:::

## Create a new rule

1. Sign in to the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io).
2. In the navigation bar, select **Settings > Webhooks > Rules**.
3. Select **Create new rule**.
   The **Create new rule** modal is displayed.
4. From the **Rule type** dropdown, select the event you would like to be notified of. See [Rule types](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types) for more details of the events that trigger a webhook and the details included in the notification.
5. In the **Company** dropdown, select the company that you would like to monitor, or select **All companies** to make all companies trigger this rule.
6. By default, webhooks triggered by rules are shown in the Codat Portal, but you can also choose to send them by email or post them to a webhook. To do this:
   - In the **Email addresses to notify** box, enter a comma-separated list of email addresses that should receive the notification.
   - In the **Webhook notification URL** box enter the URL that you would like webhook details posted to. See [Rule types](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types) for more details.
7. Select **Save changes**.

## Update an existing rule

You can update the company you want to monitor, or the notification methods you want to use for a rule at any time.

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 in [Create a new rule](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-create#create-a-new-rule).
2. On the **Rules** page, find the rule you're interested in and click its **Edit** icon.
3. Update the rule as required.
4. Select **Save changes**.
