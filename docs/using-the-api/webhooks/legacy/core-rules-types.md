:::caution New webhook service available

This page describes the functionality of our legacy webhook offering. [Learn more](/using-the-api/webhooks/overview) about our new webhook service and see how you can [migrate](/using-the-api/webhooks/migration-guide) to use it instead.

:::

The following rules can be configured in the Codat Portal to trigger webhook events. These can be use to help your respond to changes in your companies and their data.

## Rules and payloads

:::caution Removing non-reference data from webhook body

In line with industry standard security practices, we have removed personally identifiable information, such as `companyName`, from the body of our webhooks. This leaves only referential information, such as `companyId`, which can be looked up using our API.
