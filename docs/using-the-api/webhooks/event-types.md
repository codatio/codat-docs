Codat supports the following event types you can [consume](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer) using the Codat Portal or our API. Use them to respond to changes in your companies and their data.

Navigate to **Monitor > Webhooks > Events > Event Catalog** to view this list and each event's payload directly in the [Portal](https://app.codat.io/monitor/events). 

:::caution Still using our legacy rules?

See our migration guide to [switch to new event types](/using-the-api/webhooks/migrating-to-new-event-types).
