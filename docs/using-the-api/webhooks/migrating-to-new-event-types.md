Following the release of our [new webhook event types](link-to-announcement) here's our simple guide to help you migrate your existing webhooks. 

We will cover

- How your existing event types relate to our new event types.
- How the schemas map between new and old.
- How to reproduce behavours on the clients side for event types that will not be replaced. 

## How to migrate to a new event type
To ensure a smooth transition to the new event type, we recommend using an "expand/contract" strategy. This approach allows your system to handle both the old and new event types during the migration, minimizing potential disruptions. Below are the detailed steps:

### 1. Update your application logic

Modify your application logic to handle both the existing and the new event types concurrently. This ensures that your system can process either type during the migration period.

#### Create a new webhook consumer

- Implement a new POST endpoint specifically designed to consume the new event type.
- Introduce a feature toggle (a switch that controls the activation of a feature) to manage this new endpoint. Initially, keep the feature toggle disabled to prevent the new endpoint from processing any events.

#### Update the existing webhook consumer

Apply the same feature toggle to your existing webhook consumer. When this toggle is enabled, it should stop processing events from the old event type.

### 2. Configure the new webhook consumer in the portal

- In the portal, configure the new webhook consumer to point to the newly created endpoint.
- [Read more about configuring webhook consumers](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer).

### 3. Validate the new webhook consumer

Test the new webhook consumer to ensure it is correctly receiving and processing the new event type. You can perform this validation by sending test events and checking the logs in the portal (**Monitor > Events** and view the endpoint).

### 4. Enable the feature toggle for the new event type

Once youâ€™ve confirmed that the new webhook consumer is functioning correctly, enable the feature toggle. This will direct your application to process events via the new webhook consumer without losing events.

### 5. Disable the old webhook consumer

Once you are happy with the new webhook consumer delete old endpoint in the portal and remove the application logic consuming the old event type.

## AccountCategoriesUpdated

Triggered when a company's accounts are categorized, this event has been replaced by two more specific webhooks: `financialStatements.categorized` and `financialStatements.recategorized`. These new webhooks provide detailed insights into who performed the categorization. With `financialStatements.categorized`, you can review Codat AI's suggested categories, while the `financialStatements.recategorized` event notifies you when an analyst updates a category. Subscribing to both webhooks replicates the behavior of the previous `AccountCategoriesUpdated` webhook.

## ClientRateLimitReached

Triggered when the client's requests to Codat's API exceed the current quota, this event now follows our updated schema standards.
The only change between the event types is the schema's alignment with these new standards.

| RuleType | Maps to eventType |
|---|---|
| `Rate Limit Reached` | [`client.rateLimit.reached`](/platform-api#/webhooks/client.rateLimit.reached/post) |

## DataConnectionStatusChanged

Triggered whenever a data connection's status changes, this event has been replaced by new webhooks that offer more detailed context on the state transition. The new webhooks now include the [full connection schema](/platform-api#/schemas/Connection), ensuring consistency across our APIs and webhooks.

## DataSyncCompleted

Triggered upon the completion of a data synchronization, this event generates a notification for each `dataType` as the sync finishes.
The new webhook, which replaces this event, is also triggered when a data synchronization is complete, regardless of the outcome.
However, the updated payload now includes detailed information about the read operation's outcome, including the status of the synchronization (e.g., successful completion) and whether any records were modified.

[Read more about how to read data](/using-the-api/get-data). TODO: We need to update this doc to outline how clients can use this webhook to programmatically read data from our cache.

> Tip
> When adopting the new schema, ensure that you handle all elements in the dataTypes array to maintain future compatibility.

## DataSyncStatusChangedToError

Triggered when the synchronization of a dataset fails, the replacement webhook now includes information on whether the data was successfully read into Codat's cache.
This provides insight into both the completion of the read operation and its outcome.

## DatasetDataChanged

Triggered when a dataset synchronization completes and results in updates within Codat's data cache, such as the creation of new records or changes to existing ones.
The replacement webhook now provides information on when the data in Codat's cache was last modified and whether any records within a data type have been updated since the previous read operation.
To replicate the behavior of the DatasetDataChanged webhook, you can check if the recordsModified Boolean for the data type is true.

[Read more about how to read data](/using-the-api/get-data). TODO: We need to update this doc to outline how clients can use this webhook to programmatically read data from our cache.

> Tip
> When adopting the new schema, ensure that you handle all elements in the dataTypes array to maintain future compatibility.

## NewCompanySynchronized

This event type will no longer be supported. 

## PushOperationStatusChanged

Triggered when the status of a push operation changes.
For better clarity on the outcome of the push operation, use the replacement webhooks: `{dataType}.write.successful` and `{dataType}.write.unsuccessful`.
These event types provide detailed information, including whether the push operation was successful, along with the record ID and attachment ID when creating, updating, or deleting records.

| RuleType | Data.status | Maps to eventType |
|---|---|---|
| `Push Operation Status Changed()` | `Successful`  | [`{dataType}.write.successful`](/platform-api#/webhooks/bills.write.successful/post) |
| `Push Operation Status Changed()` | `TimedOut` or `Failed`  | [`{dataType}.write.unsuccessful`](/platform-api#/webhooks/bills.write.unsuccessful/post) |
