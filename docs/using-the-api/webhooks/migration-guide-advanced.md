## Should I migrate to the new service and endpoints?

If you are considering using Codat's new webhook management endpoints, check that your setup is compatible first. Find the scenarios applicable to your existing setup and see if you can migrate.

## Critical considerations

### Event log endpoints

Our new service has a robust [retry policy](/using-the-api/webhooks/troubleshooting#retry-policy) that ensures we attempt to deliver an event multiple times over a 28-hour period. This means you don't need to write any complex logic to manage undelivered events. As a result, you no longer need to use any of these endpoints:

- `GET /rules/alerts`
- `GET /rules/{ruleId}/alerts`
- `GET /rules/alerts/{alertId}`

Check out the [deprecation notice](/updates/240306-deprecation-rules-alerts) for full details of these changes. 

### Email notification functionality  

Our new webhooks service supports sending notifications for events using our [Zapier app](https://zapier.com/apps/codat/integrations), so you can build automated workflows to send email, Slack, or other notifications. Use our webhook events as triggers and drive actions in all of the tools you use, from Google Sheets to SalesForce.

For detailed instructions on creating automated notifications with Zapier, see our [Zapier guide](/using-the-api/webhooks/zapier-integration).

### `RuleId` in existing logic

If you are using `RuleId` properties returned by our existing webhooks in your application logic, review and update your application logic to remove any dependencies on the `RuleId`. This will help prevent any disruptions to your integration with Codat.

You should use `RuleType` to identify what event a given webhook corresponds with.

Check out the [deprecation notice](/updates/240320-deprecation-ruleId) for full details of these changes.

## Additional considerations

Depending on your setup, you may need to configure your webhook consumers in Codat further or be aware of changes to the UI. 

### IP allowlist

If your consumer endpoint is behind a firewall or NAT, make sure to allow messages from `4.159.114.108`.

### Source client header

If you are using multiple Codat instances and need to differentiate between them, you can filter the messages by client using a custom `X-Codat-ClientId` header. 

If you are already using this header in your existing setup, we will include it when migrating your rules to the new service. For more information on creating custom headers in webhook consumers, see [Custom headers](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer#custom-headers).

### Webhook auth header

If you are currently securing your webhook endpoints with an authorization header, you can add it as a custom `Authorization` header to the webhook consumer endpoint using our Portal. It is no longer possible to do this via our API.

If you are already using this header in your existing setup, we will include it when migrating your rules to the new service. For more information on creating custom headers in webhook consumers, see [Custom headers](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer#custom-headers).

### `Retry-After` header

Our new service has a robust [retry policy](/using-the-api/webhooks/troubleshooting#retry-policy) that ensures we attempt to deliver an event multiple times over a 28-hour period. As a result, you no longer need to set a `Retry-After` header to control the time between retries. 

### Company-specific webhooks

With the new service, you are able to see the `companyId` in the **Channels** field of the endpoint's detailed view or the message log.
