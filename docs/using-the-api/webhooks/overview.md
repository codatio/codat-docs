## Introduction to {Service Name} Webhooks
Webhooks are how services notify each other of events. At their core they are just a  `POST`  request to a pre-determined endpoint. The endpoint can be whatever you want, and you can just  [add them from the UI](#adding-an-endpoint). You normally use one endpoint per service, and that endpoint listens to all of the event types. For example, if you receive webhooks from Acme Inc., you can structure your URL like:  `https://www.example.com/acme/webhooks/`.

The way to indicate that a webhook has been processed is by returning a  `2xx`  (status code  `200-299`) response to the webhook message within a reasonable time-frame (15s). It's also important to disable  `CSRF`  protection for this endpoint if the framework you use enables them by default.

Another important aspect of handling webhooks is to verify the signature and timestamp when processing them. You can learn more about it in the  [webhook signature verification](#webhook-signature-verification).

## Retries
Svix attempts to deliver each webhook message based on a retry schedule with exponential backoff.

### The schedule
Each message is attempted based on the following schedule, where each period is started following the failure of the preceding attempt:

-   Immediately
-   5 seconds
-   5 minutes
-   30 minutes
-   2 hours
-   5 hours
-   10 hours
-   10 hours (in addition to the previous)

If an endpoint is removed or disabled delivery attempts to the endpoint will be disabled as well.

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

## IP Whitelist
In case your webhook receiving endpoint is behind a firewall or NAT, you may need to allow traffic from Svix's IP addresses.

Codat's webhook rules are served from static IP addresses. This means that you are able to apply an allowlisting rule to grant network access to these notifications.
