![Webhooks at Codat](/img/updates/240306-webhooks-announcement.png)

_Webhooks_ are an automated way for an app to notify you when a specific event occurs. At their core, they are a `POST` request with a payload that is sent to a unique URL of an endpoint that you determine. 

We refer to the HTTP endpoints that you configure to subscribe to Codat's events as _webhook consumers_. A `2XX` (status code `200-299`) response from the consumer indicates that the webhook message was successfully received. 

With our webhook service, you can leverage the following benefits:

- Automatic retries of failed webhook deliveries according to our [retry schedule](/using-the-api/webhooks/troubleshooting#retry-policy)
- Detailed event logging with a full overview of delivery attempts and payloads
- Make your solution robust with easy event replay to reprocess past events or retry failed events
- Mock event functionality to simplify your testing and development

:::note Using our legacy webhooks? 

If you have been using our webhooks before March 6, 2024, we recommend migrating them to the new service.
See how you can migrate in our [migration guide](/using-the-api/webhooks/migration-guide).

You can view the old webhook service documentation here:

- [Create or update rules](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-create)
- [Listen to events](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-webhooks)
- [Webhook security](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-webhooksecurity)
- [Receive webhook events as emails](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/receive-webhooks-as-email)
:::

:::caution After migration, the endpoint to [list webhook consumers](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/operations/list-webhook-consumers) does not currently support
   pagination or query parameters. We are looking to rectify this as soon as we possibly can. We are proactively reaching out to all clients who leverage these features but 
   if you have any concerns please feel free to reach out to support@codat.io
