### Process

To perform an attachment upload request, follow these steps:

1. **[Make a write request](#make-a-write-request)**: Once completed, you will receive a write request ID, which can be used to track the status of the request.

2. **[Consume the relevant `{dataType}.write.{unsuccessful,successful}` webhook](#consume-the-data-types-write-webhook)**: Subscribe to this webhook to receive notifications on the success or failure of the write request.

    app ->> codat: Upload attachment
    codat -->> app: write ID (pushOperationKey)

    codat ->> app: {dataType}.write.{un}successful webhook
```

## Make a write request

To upload an attachment to a record, youâ€™ll need the company ID, relevant connection ID, the record ID for the data type, and the file itself.

## Consume the data type's write webhook

Subscribe to the [`{dataType}.write.{un}successful`](/platform-api#/webhooks/dataType-.write.successful/post) webhook to track the outcome of a completed write request.
The payload includes information about the company, record ID to upload the attachment to and, on success, the attachment ID.

In the **Settings > Webhooks > Events > Configure consumer** [view](https://app.codat.io/monitor/events) of the Codat Portal, click **Add endpoint** to create a webhook consumer that listens for the `{dataType}.write.{un}successful` event types. You can review detailed instructions in our documentation for [consuming webhook messages](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer).
