While the Portal provides a simple way of exploring data, you'll need to use the Codat API to get the most out of your company data.

## APIs

We've packaged up Codat's functionality mainly by *product*, with our *Platform API* providing core functionalities used across our product. You can explore each API and its endpoints in our API references.
