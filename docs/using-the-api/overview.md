While the Portal provides a simple way of exploring data, you'll need to use the Codat API to get the most out of your company data.

## APIs

We've packaged up Codat's functionality mainly by *product*, with our *Platform API* providing core functionalities used across our product. You can explore each API and its endpoints in our API references.

| Product API &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp | Description |
| :- | :- |
| **[Bank Feeds API](/bank-feeds-api)** | Set up bank feeds from accounts in your application to supported accounting software. |
| **[Lending API](/lending-api)** | Make credit decisions backed by enhanced financials, metrics, reports, and data integrity features. |
| **[Sync for Commerce](/sync-for-commerce-api)** | Write merchants' data from your e-commerce or point-of-sale (POS) platform into your merchants' accounting software. |
| **[Sync for Expenses](/sync-for-expenses-api)** | Streamline expense reconciliation from the corporate card and expense management systems to your customers' accounting software. |
