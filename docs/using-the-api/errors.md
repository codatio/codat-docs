## Example account limit errors

When an API request causes an account limit to be exceeded, you'll receive a 402 response code. The response body indicates which account limit was exceeded.

### 50-company limit

Error response from [POST /companies](/platform-api#/operations/create-company) when you have exceeded the 50-company limit that applies to the Free trial.

For example:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 402,
  "service": "PublicApi",
  "error": "CompanyValidationException: Company limit exceeded",
  "correlationId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "validation": {
    "errors": [
      {
        "itemId": "Company",
        "message": "Company limit exceeded. Learn more at https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/errors",
        "validatorName": "CreateCompany"
      }
    ],
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

### 365 day free account limit

Error response when your account has expired and you make a request to any endpoint. This error is returned if your Free account is older than 365 days and has expired.

```json
{
  "statusCode": 402,
  "service": "PublicApi",
  "error": "Payment Required",
  "correlationId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "validation": {
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "Account expired. Learn more at https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/errors"
      }
    ],
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

## Correlation IDs in error responses

The content of an error response includes a more detailed error message and a `correlationId`, which can be used to identify a particular response. Please include the `correlationId` in text format if you are contacting Codat support regarding an error.

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "service": "QuickBooksOnline",
  "error": "InvoicePdfNotFoundException: Invoice not found for company 360cb9b3-d9cf-4f66-b8db-8a3523fe3dc5 and invoice ID 12345",
  "correlationId": "131f0225-5467-421a-b179-4531d6b4a942"
}
```

## Status codes in asynchronous write responses

Status codes for write operations created in the Codat API might be different from the status codes returned in the responses from the service providers.

When a write operation is created in the API, some service providers may use a `202 Accepted` code, which implies that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not completed. However, the write API may return a `200 Success code` for the write operation successfully created in the Codat API.

You've learned about error codes you might encounter while using the API.
