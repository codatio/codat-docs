Codat provides a second line support function during UK business hours (09:00 to 17:00 Monday to Friday) and can be contacted via our [support request form](https://codat.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new).

:::caution Access to support

## Can I ask the user to contact Codat Support directly?

Our support team does not provide direct support to end-users so you should contact Codat on their behalf. If we need to do any direct troubleshooting with the user, we will arrange this with you.

## Status Page

Codat has a live status page where you can get updates on how our systems are doing. If there are interruptions to service, we will post a note there.

This can be accessed here https://status.codat.io/
