## Journey overview

The diagram below represents the overall activity flow when using Bank Feeds API, including your SMB customer and their accounting software. It assumes you are using Codat's mapping interface to let the user select the accounts used for writing bank statements.

If you are using one of the [other mapping UI options](/bank-feeds/mapping/overview), you can visualize the flow by simply changing the actor of the mapping operation from `Codat` to `Your application` or `Accounting software`.

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant smb as SMB customer
    participant app as Your application 
    participant codat as Codat
    participant acctg as Accounting software
    
    smb ->> app: Logs into application
    smb ->> app: Initiates connection to accounting software

    app ->> codat: Passes company and connection details
    app ->> codat: Initiates auth flow
    codat ->> smb: Displays auth flow
    smb ->> codat: Authorizes connection
    codat ->> acctg: Establishes connection
    
    codat ->> smb: Displays mapping options
    smb ->> codat: Confirms mapping selections
    
    loop Load bank statements
        smb ->> app: Spends money from bank account
        app ->> codat: Writes bank transaction details
        codat ->> acctg: Creates bank transactions
        acctg ->> smb: Displays loaded bank statement ready for reconciliation
    end

```

Once you decide to build this flow with Bank Feeds API, you need to configure Codat accordingly. Let's go through these requirements in detail.

## Enable Bank Feeds API

Reach out to your Codat account manager to enable Bank Feeds API for your client. 

## Manage data sources

In the <a href="https://app.codat.io" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>, navigate to **Settings > Integrations** and click **Manage integrations**. Next, click **Manage** next to the specific integration you want to enable and set it up to serve as a data source for the product. 

<IntegrationsList integrations={bankfeedsIntegrations}/>

Some of these integrations require additional setup specific to bank feeds. We walk you through these in our integration-specific instructions in the _Manage integrations_ section of our Bank Feeds API documentation. 

## Authorization flow

As part of using Bank Feeds API, you will need your customers to authorize your access to their data. To do so, use [Link](/auth-flow/authorize-embedded-link) - our pre-built, embeddable, conversion-optimized, and white-labeled authorization flow. 

The solution lets you tailor the authorization journey to your business needs. You can:

* [Customize Link settings](/auth-flow/customize/customize-link).
* [Set up company branding](/auth-flow/customize/branding).
* [Set up redirects](/auth-flow/customize/set-up-redirects).

## Webhooks

Codat supports a range of [webhook events](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types) to help you manage your data pipelines. In the <a href="https://app.codat.io" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>, navigate to **Settings > Webhooks > Configure consumer** and click **Add endpoint** to set up an endpoint to listen to the following event type and get the most out of Bank Feeds API:

- [PushOperationStatusChanged](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types)  

  Use this webhook to track the completion of the operation to create bank transactions in the target platform. When you receive a notification from this webhook, check the `status` value in the body. A `Success` status means the `transactions` array has been successfully written to the accounting software. In case of errors, resolve the issue and resend the payload.


## Client libraries

### Frontend

Our low-code [Bank Feeds SDK](/bank-feeds/create-account) lets you build a seamless, high-converting user experience, embedded right within your front-end application.

##### NPM
```sh
npm add @codat/sdk-bank-feeds-types
```

##### Yarn
```sh
yarn add @codat/sdk-bank-feeds-types
```

[Read more...](/bank-feeds/create-account)

### Backend

For your bankend services, use our comprehensive [Bank Feeds API library](/get-started/libraries) to kick-start and simplify your build. 
Simply install the library in one of the supported languages and pass your base64-encoded API key to the constructor.

:::tip Recap

You have enabled Bank Feeds API, set up the relevant integrations, configured auth flow parameters, and noted the recommended webhook. This completes the initial setup of the product. 

Next, you will create a Codat [company](../terms/company), its [connection](../terms/connection), and a source bank account to build out the core infrastructure required to establish a bank feed.
