When the SMB user visits the `linkUrl`, they're directed to the QuickBooks Online Bank Feeds Link UI. This site allows the SMB user to generate a one-time username and password for connecting one or more bank accounts to QuickBooks Online (QBO).

:::caution Link URL expiry

For security reasons, the `linkUrl` will expire one hour after it was generated.

## Summary of SMB user connection flow

To connect their bank accounts to QBO, the SMB user performs the following steps in the QBO Bank Feeds Link UI and in their QBO account.

### Generate one-time credentials

1. From within your application, the SMB user opens the `linkUrl` in their browser.

   The QBO Bank Feeds Link UI is loaded.

2. On the **Connect to QuickBooks Online Bank Feeds** page, they review the requested permissions, then click **Next**.

3. On the **Set up QuickBooks** page, they click **Get credentials** to generate their unique one-time username and password for connecting an account to QBO (see step six in the next procedure). The **Revoke credentials** button appears immediately after their credentials are generated &mdash; see [Revoke credentials](#revoke-credentials) to learn more.

4. They follow the instructions displayed in the UI. These are summarized in the next procedure.

### Enter one-time credentials in QuickBooks

1. The SMB user signs in to QBO.

   - If in Accounting View, they select **Banking**.
   - If in Business View, they go to **Bookkeeping >Bank Transactions**.

2. They click the **Link account** button.

3. On the **Connect an account** screen, they find and select your organization from the list of institutions that provide bank feeds.

4. They agree to the terms and conditions.

5. They enter their one-time username and password into QuickBooks and complete the authentication prompt.

6. They select one or more source bank accounts to connect to QBO.

7. In the dropdown that appears, they select the account type — the chart of accounts — that they want to view bank feeds for.

8. They select a start date for the bank feed.

   :::caution Limitation on pushing historic transactions
   
   If the SMB user selects a bank feed start date older than seven days, it will be ignored. The integration only supports pushing historic transactions up to seven days old.

   :::

9. Finally, they click **Connect**.

Your SMB user has now successfully connected their chosen bank accounts to QBO. The status of the data connection changes to `Linked`; you can now [push bank transactions to QBO](/bank-feeds-api/qbo-bank-feeds/qbo-bank-feeds-push-bank-transactions) for the SMB user.

### Revoke credentials

The **Revoke credentials** button allows the SMB user to revoke their previously generated credentials. This option invalidates all their existing credentials; you can no longer push bank transactions to QBO from any bank accounts that used those credentials.
