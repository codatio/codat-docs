App Partnership is required to go live with Xero Bank Feeds. It is crucial you begin the partner application process before you start your Codat implementation, because the application may take months to process. 

Please speak to your Codat account team to initiate this process. It will involve:

- An introduction to Xero’s Financial Services Partnerships team
- Submitting a Bank Feeds Integration Proposal
- Signing Xero’s Bank Feeds Partnership Agreement (non-commercial)
- Passing a technical certification process

#### Xero’s technical requirements

Xero’s technical requirements are complex, but Codat’s Bank Feeds API take care of many of them for you. We recommend working closely with Codat to ensure you address all of Xero’s requirements during your implementation.
