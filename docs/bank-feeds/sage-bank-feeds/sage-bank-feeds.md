:::caution Sage Bank Feeds - Beta

Our Sage Bank Feeds integration is currently in beta. You can provide feedback on the integration in <a className="external" href="https://codat.productboard.com/feature-board/1378101-feature-organization/features/11073763/detail" target="_blank">Productboard</a> or by contacting your Solutions Engineer or Account Manager.

## Overview

With our Sage Bank Feeds integration, you can enable a Sage user to set up a bank feed from a bank account in your application (the source account) to an account in a supported Sage product (the target account). You can then push [Bank transactions](/bank-feeds-api#/operations/create-bank-transactions) from the source account to the target account.

With access to bank feeds, your customers can more easily reconcile bank transactions against accounting entries, like invoices and bills.

:::note Supported Sage products

You can push bank transactions to several [supported Sage products](/bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds/#supported-sage-products).

## Supported data types and operations

Bank feeds are represented as streams of [Bank transactions](/bank-feeds-api#/operations/create-bank-transactions) pushed to Codat in chronological order.

## How it works

1. [Set up the integration](/bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds-setup).
2. Your end user can set up a bank feed using the _Connect Bank_ feature in a supported Sage product. They find your institution and then select a source bank account to send bank transactions from.
  
  They are redirected to a Codat UI to enter their data connection ID to authenticate with the integration - see the [SMB user flow](/bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds-setup#smb-user-flow-connect-a-source-bank-account-to-sage) for details. Alternatively, you can [authenticate users through your own web app](/bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds-authenticate-users-web-app).
3. You push transactions for authenticated users to Codat using the [Create bank transactions](/bank-feeds-api#/operations/create-bank-transactions) endpoint - see [Use your Sage Bank Feeds integration](/bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds/sage-bank-feeds-use) for details.

## Supported Sage products

Our integration supports pushing bank feeds to several Sage products, including Sage Business Cloud, Sage Intacct, and Sage 50. For a complete list, see the [supported regions and products](https://developer.sage.com/banking-service/provider-api/banking-service/supported-regions-products/).
