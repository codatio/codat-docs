Quickly provide an outstanding mapping experience for your customers with minimal development effort by using our pre-built mapping user interface. It is designed to meet all third-party requirements and can be customized to match your logo and primary color scheme.

## Map an account

Direct your customer to the `linkUrl` returned in the [Create a connection](/bank-feeds/create-account#create-a-connection) response. After they've authorized your access to their accounting software, they'll be taken to Codat's mapping UI (as seen on the screenshot below) where they will map their source account to an existing or a new target account within their accounting software.

![Codat-bank-feeds_account-mapping-ui](/img/bank-feeds/mappingUi.png "Codat-provided account mapping UI")

The target accounts listed in the UI are filtered based on the parameters of the source account. For example, if the source account is a credit card in a USD currency, only USD credit accounts will appear in the "Target options" dropdown list.

When a user has successfully mapped and linked their account, they will be redirected to your application based on the [redirect parameters](/auth-flow/customize/set-up-redirects) you configured.

You can also poll the [List bank feed account mappings](/bank-feeds-api#/operations/get-bank-account-mapping) endpoint to check whether an account has been mapped successfully.

## Manage connections

To allow your SMB users to view and manage their existing bank feed connections, you can direct them to a newly-generated `linkUrl`. When they open this URL and revisit the account mapping UI, their existing connections will be displayed in the **Manage your connected accounts** panel.

![xero-bank-feeds_account-mapping-ui-manage-feed-connections](/img/bank-feeds/xero-bank-feeds/xero-bank-feeds_account-mapping-ui-manage-feed-connections.png "Codat-provided account mapping UI showing several connected accounts in the bottom panel.")

To disconnect a source bank account, the SMB user should hover over the **connected** status icon and select **Disconnect**. This immediately disables the bank feed connection. The disconnected account will display as an option in the "Source bank account" dropdown menu when the user next refreshes the mapping page.
