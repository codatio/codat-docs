Once you have created the source account, provide your customer with a user interface (UI) so they can select the target accounts in their accounting platform. This will tell us where exactly a bank feed should be established. You can use one of the following options to provide the mapping UI:

### Map using our interface
##### [Learn more →](/bank-feeds/mapping/codat-ui)

Use our pre-built mapping interface to launch your app with minimal development effort. It is designed to meet all third-party requirements and supports logo and primary color scheme customization. 

<IntegrationsList integrations={bankfeedsInternalMappingIntegrations}/>

### Map using our API
##### [Learn more →](/bank-feeds/mapping/api-mapping)

For a more integrated user experience, you can build your own interface using our API's account mapping endpoints so that your users can map their accounts directly within your application. 

<IntegrationsList integrations={bankfeedsInternalMappingIntegrations}/>

### Platform-specific mapping

Integrations listed in this section require that the account mapping is conducted within the accounting platform itself. Follow our integration-specific bank feed guides to learn more about their prerequisites, functionality, and implementation details.
