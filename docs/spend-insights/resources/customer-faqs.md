This page provides guidance on communicating the value and benefits of sharing business data to your customers and addressing their concerns and questions. The answers are written from your organization's perspective, so you can share them exactly as they are or amend them to reflect your business processes.

## Communicating benefits

You can earn higher rebates from cards, streamline your operations, boost working capital, and protect your business against check fraud if you share vendor information with us via a seamless secure digital journey.

### Why share information?

Your business's up-to-date and detailed spend and supplier information will help us better support your payables optimization journey, driving up the rebates you earn and further boosting your working capital.

In the past we may have asked you to compile and share a vendor spend file. Now, you can securely share your information over an encrypted digital connection in a few
clicks. Your login ID and password won't be shared and we won't be able to log in to your account. 

Instead, we will be able to download a report showing your most recent suppliers and associated invoices, then use it to analyze your spend and offer our expert advice.

As a result, your business can enjoy the following benefits:

1. **Better card program results**

	- Enhance your rebate earnings and optimize your working capital.
	- Drive higher card acceptance and better payment optimization with deeper supplier and spend insights.

2. **Significant time savings**

	Replace time spent on dealing with vendor spend files with automatic secure digital data sharing. 

3. **Continuous supplier insights**

	Maximize card program effectiveness by enabling us to identify and onboard card-receptive suppliers, retain those already accepting card, and re-engage lapsed suppliers. 

4. **Faster program implementation**

	Accelerate setup for new card programs, resulting in quicker rebate realization and improved cash flow. 

5. **Share data securely**

	- Encrypted data sharing in transit and at rest makes digital data sharing more secure than email.
	- We can't access your login credentials or your account and only use your data to optimize your card program.

### How to get started?

Sharing your information digitally is easy and secure, and you can do so in three easy steps:

1. Ensure you have admin-level access.

	You need to be an administrator user (or equivalent) of your accounting software to set up digital data sharing. 

2. Schedule a call with us. 

	Get in touch with your representative so that they can guide you through the setup process that takes just a few minutes.

3. Enjoy the benefits!

	Your representative or account manager will access your business's up-to-date spend analysis reports and optimize your card program to grow your rebates.

## Addressing questions and concerns

### Building trust

#### Who is Codat? I don't trust them with my data

We have partnered with Codat to simplify the process of sharing data from your ERP or accounting software. Codat provides the technical infrastructure that acts as a secure bridge between your software and our app, ensuring they stay in sync. They implement strong security measures to safeguard your data and treat it with the utmost care and confidentiality.

We use this data to provide you with a customized service. If you choose to share your data with us via Codat, Codat will not share it with anyone else. Codat doesn't sell the data they have access to.

#### Why am I sharing my data?

Sharing a spend file is one of the essential pieces for driving the success of your card program. This information enables us to accurately analyze your spend, identify cardable opportunities within your supply chain and, ultimately, help you achieve your AP goals. This includes improving working capital, preserving float, increasing rebate revenue, or other goals your finance team may have.

However, we understand that it can be challenging to share this information. Sharing this information directly from your financial software is a new option that saves you time and removes the hassle of manually submitting financial data to us. The journey to connect your financial software takes just a couple of minutes and is a faster and more secure way of providing this information. It also means that we will have access to the most up-to-date and relevant financial data to provide our service.

#### I don't want anyone to see or change all my data

Our use of your data is subject to your consent, and we aren't permitted to use it for anything beyond what you approve. You control this access and Codat will ask you to provide authorization before the access is granted. Neither we nor Codat will have access to your login credentials through the connection. 

#### Is my data safe?

Codat employs a comprehensive data security program. Your data is encrypted in transit using at least TLS 1.2 protocol, and at rest using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) technology. It is protected to the standards required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Codat are externally certified to ISO 27001 information security standards. 

### Connection concerns

#### I want to connect but I don't have the right permissions

We recommend involving your ERP or software administrator to ensure a smooth connection process.

#### The connection process looks complicated

Our connection journeys are designed for simplicity and won't take more than a few minutes. Additionally, we provide on-call support to guide you through the process for a seamless experience.

:::tip Need more support?

We provide step-by-step walkthroughs on connecting to every accounting software and ERP that Codat supports on our dedicated [Help Hub](https://help.codat.io/resources/about). You can share the relevant software links with your customers.

#### I’m not sure which company to connect

If you're unsure which company is relevant to your virtual card program, we can advise you based on your program details. If it's unclear how to interpret company and entity names in your software, we recommend you consult your system administrator or finance team. 

#### We have multiple instances, and I don’t want to connect them all

You don't have to! Only connect the instances where you record accounts payable information relevant to your virtual card usage. This will help achieve maximum program efficiency.

#### I don’t want to disrupt my current plug-ins

Our secure connection process shouldn't interfere with other services. Please confirm the requirements of your specific platform with us. 

#### I can't filter the suppliers I share

During onboarding, discuss supplier exclusions with us so that we can tailor the process to your needs.

#### I'm worried this process will take longer than the current one

The connection process typically takes less than 30 minutes and can often be completed in a single call. Moreover, we will be able to get up-to-date data from you in the future without any additional effort. 

### Technical support

#### The connection link you shared is blacklisted

Contact your IT team and request to allow access to the `codat.io` domain. We can provide security credentials and documentation to address any concerns.

#### We are migrating to a new accounting software

If migration isn’t complete, the data in your current software remains valid for the initial assessment. Let us know what your new accounting software is going to be so that we can check future compatibility.

### Data sharing and access

#### Who has access to my data?

We use your data to provide you with your card program service. You can review review our Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy for data usage details or request
data deletion at any time.

#### What happens to my data if I disconnect?

Disconnecting stops us from performing any future data retrieval. You can also request full account data deletion by contacting us.

#### What data am I sharing?

You will be sharing your supplier and accounts payable information. This allows us to calculate who you are paying, how much you are paying, and how you are paying them. From this, we can determine what savings and value a virtual card payments solution could deliver to your organization.

Specific data you will share may include, but is not limited to, company information, suppliers, bills, bill payments, bill credit notes, direct costs, payment methods, and tax rates.

#### I want to control what information I share

Using this secure, simplified process, we only retrieve the same data you’d share with us manually. We always tell you which data we plan to use, and our data usage is subject to your consent.

#### I don’t want you to have ongoing access to my software

You have full control over our access to the data in your ERP or accounting software and can stop sharing anytime from within your software. For detailed access management instructions, consult Codat’s [Help Hub](https://help.codat.io). Alternatively, let us know and we can instruct Codat to do remove the connection.

### Internal objections

#### My company has a policy against data sharing

Let us know the details of your company policy so that we can address specific concerns. We only request information already provided manually, now streamlined and secured for a faster, more complete service.

#### I need IT department approval

Let us know once you receive approval to establish the digital sharing connection from your IT department. We can provide security documentation to assist your IT team.

#### Your bank is not my primary bank. Do you offer the digital connection service for other banks?

That’s okay! We can connect to your accounting software to evaluate suppliers without needing access to another bank’s systems. Other banks currently don’t offer this technology.

#### I don’t have time for a setup call

The call usually takes 10–30 minutes. Alternatively, we provide self-serve instructions to support the connection process. You can always contact your representative if you need assistance.

### Value exchange

#### Why connect again if I already did this previously?

This connection focuses on supplier and spend data to optimize payments and doesn’t interfere with existing integrations.

#### I’m happy with my current data sharing process

Our digital sharing process is faster, more secure, and less time-consuming than manual file submissions. You also only need to connect your ERP or accounting software once while continuing to reap the benefits of the connection going forward.

#### Why can't I continue sharing CSV files?

Manual CSV sharing is still an option that's available to you. However, automated connections provide us with real-time data for better, quicker program optimization and supplier onboarding.
