Below is what the journey will look like from their perspective:
1 After clicking on the email link they will be taken to the ‘Connect’ screen,
which will initiate the connection journey:

Client will be asked to sign into their account in order to authorize the link

Customer selects their accounting software (NetSuite or QuickBooks Online)
and clicks ‘Next’

They will then be shown a consent screen describing the data they are
sharing and can select ‘next’

The client will then be taken to the instructional page for connecting NetSuite or QuickBooks
Online. This is still part of the Codat link journey, so the client will need to alternate between
this tab and their NetSuite or QuickBooks Online account. It is important that they perform
each step in NetSuite or QuickBooks Online and return to this tab in the browser.

The connection journey is what the customer will see and do on their computer,
using NetSuite or QuickBooks Online. For the pilot, the Codat Client Success
Manager will guide the customer through the steps they need to successfully link
their NetSuite or QuickBooks Online software. However, the journey is enabled to
allow customers to self-serve, with simple, easy-to-follow instructions.
