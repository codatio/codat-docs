Spend Analysis file: Supplier Analysis Tab definitions
In the Supplier Analysis tab, you’ll be able to view supplier details, payment
methods, amounts, and terms. Let’s take a look at the different columns and go
through what they are, and what they mean, and how to read the details and
data.
The columns go by color and you’ll first see the supplier’s name, the most
common method used to pay them, and imported date:
Supplier Name: Supplier name from the ERP.
Most Common Payment Method: An aggregation of the most common method
used to pay the supplier historically. The buyer could have paid Swift - Rippin with
a debit card once or twice, but this shows which method is the most commonly
used.
Imported Date: The date that the supplier first showed up in the Spend Analysis
file. This becomes significant when reviewing files on an ongoing basis.
For example, Swift - Rippin was first imported to the spend analysis file on 8/19. If
you download a spend analysis file a month later, you would be able to identify
new suppliers that show up by using the imported date.

Details & Data: The supplier, Swift - Rippin, is most commonly paid by bank
transfers and this supplier first showed up in the Spend Analysis file on August 19,
2024. 

The next section goes into the bill details, highlighting what the supplier has
raised with the business

# of Bills: Number of bills raised by the supplier 

# of Bills Outstanding: Number of outstanding bills that have not yet been
paid 

Bills Amount: The # of Bills raised amount

Bills Outstanding Amount: The # of Bills Outstanding amount

% of Bills Outstanding (by amount): Bills Outstanding Amt as a percentage
of Bills Amt 

Most Recent Bill: Most recent bill raised by the supplier

Details & Data: Let’s look at the second row down where # of Bills is 2, and # of
Bills Outstanding is 1. This supplier has raised 2 bills and has 1 outstanding. The
Bills Amt of the 2 bills is $543,080, and the Bills Outstanding Amt of the 1 bill is
$134,567. The Bills Outstanding Amt is 24.8% of the bills amount, and the most
recent bill was raised on February 25, 2024.

The payments section goes through what a business has paid to its suppliers
and more details of that:

# of Payments: Total number of payments a business has made to the
supplier

# of Late Payments: Total number of late payments a business has made to
the supplier 

Payments Amount: The # of Payments amount 

Late Payments Amount: The # of Late Payments amount 

% Late Payments (by amount): Late Payments Amt as a percentage of
Payments Amt

Average Payment Amount: The average payment size made to the supplier,
based on the # of Payments 

Details & Data: Let’s look at the first row here. A business has made 2 payments
on time to this supplier and 2 late payments. The Payments Amt and Late
Payments Amt are the same at $726,479, making the late payments 100% of the
Payments Amt. Based on 2 # of Payments at a total of $726,479, the average
payment amount to the supplier is $363,239. 

This next section covers payment terms and settlements. 

Average Payment Terms: This number shows how many days on average it
takes for a business to pay the supplier. This is weighted by payment
amount.

Common Payment Terms Days: This number is the payment term you
expect to see from the supplier. 

Average Settlement Period: This is how long it is actually taking to pay the
supplier and measures the number of days it takes for the payment to settle
and process.

Details & Data: Looking at the first row, we can see that it takes this business on
average 90 days to pay Swift - Rippin, the terms expected from them is also 90
days. However, it’s taking 110 days for the payment to settle with Swift - Rippin.
Using these numbers is helpful to identify which suppliers would benefit from
switching over to acceptance of virtual cards. 

The last section has more supplier information, such as their ID, the contact at
the company and their contact details, the tax number, and the supplier’s
address.
