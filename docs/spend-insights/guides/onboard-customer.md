Our [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/) is your one-stop shop to view the customers and relationships you are responsible for. Here, your organization's clients are represented as companies.

In this guide, we will cover the ways you can create new customers, manage existing ones, and request financial data from them.

## Create customer

Navigate to the _Companies_ tab in the Codat Portal to start the creation of a new company that represents your customer.

1. Click the **Create company** button. This will open a _Create a company_ window.

   :::caution Adding products

   You may see the **Add products** dropdown when creating a company from the _Companies_ tab. Select **Spend Insights** and continue with company creation.

## Onboard customer

You can initiate requests for your customers' accounts payable information in several ways:

- Using the **Request data** button on the _Spend Insights_ tab.
- Using the **Request data** button on the _Companies_ tab.

The steps to request this information are the same across these options:

1. Click the **Request data** button next to the relevant customer's name to open the _Onboarding_ window.

2. In the _Onboarding_ window, choose how you want to ask your customer for their data:
   - Copy the **Link URL** if you want to send a direct connection link to your customer or use the link in your own communication.
   - Copy the **Email template** if you would like support in providing additional context to your customer. You can view the template by clicking the dropdown icon.

   :::info Request data when creating customer

   You will see the **Link URL** and **Email template** when you first [create your customer](/spend-insights/guides/onboard-customer#create-customer) in Codat.

   Based on your organization's business processes, you can request data immediately after creating the customer or do it later following this process.

   :::

3. Following your organization's ways of working, share the Link URL or the email content with your customer. You can also proactively share [answers to common questions](/spend-insights/resources/customer-faqs) with them.

:::tip Next steps

You have requested supplier and spend information from your customer. Next, your customer needs to complete a connection journey to provide it to your organization. Based on the software they use, they can authorize a digital connection or upload files with supplier and bill data.

You can support your customer on this journey using the following guides:

- [**Data streaming**](/spend-insights/resources/link-software): Help your customer establish an ongoing connection with their accounting software.
- [**Intelligent file upload**](/spend-insights/resources/link-file): Direct your customer through sharing files that contain their financial information.

## Manage customers

You can view all existing customers in the _Spend Insights_ tab or the _Companies_ tab. If your customer's company has multiple subsidiaries, you can expand the parent company to view its children by clicking on the dropdown icon.

To edit or delete your existing customers, navigate to the _Companies_ tab. Click on the triple-dot menu to view the editing options dropdown. From there, you can click **Edit** to change company details or **Delete** to delete it.

:::caution Deleting a company

If you delete a company, this will also delete the data you previously received from it. As a result, you will no longer be able to access this company's reports in the Portal. This operation is not reversible.

If the company you are deleting is a parent company, you will see a pop-up window requesting manual confirmation to delete the company and its subsidiaries.
