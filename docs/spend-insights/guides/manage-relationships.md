Our [Relationship Portal](https://relationships.codat.io/) is your one-stop shop to view the clients and relationships you are responsible for. Here, your organization's clients are represented as [companies](../../terms/company). 

In this guide, we will cover the ways you can request financial data from your clients and create new companies and manage existing ones.

## Request customer information

### Add a new company

To create your client as a company in the Relationship Portal and start the onboarding process, click the **Add a company** button.  

![An image of the Relationship Portal user interface with five companies listed as examples and the Add company button highlighted](/img/spend-insights/0054-se-rm-portal-add-company.png)

This will open the company creation window with the following sections:

- **Company info**: use it to add the company name and description.
- **Contact details**: use it to add the name and email of the company's point of contact.
- **Users**: use it to assign different analysts to be responsible for the company from a dropdown list.

Company name and contact name and emails are mandatory fields, but you don't have to assign an analyst to the record - for example, if the client has not yet been allocated to a manager. 

When ready, click the **Add company** button. This creates a record in the Relationship Portal.

### Request financial data

You can request supplier and spend data from your customer in two ways:

- [During the initial company creation](#request-financial-data-during-company-creation)
- [After company creation at a later stage](#request-financial-data-after-company-creation)

#### Request financial data during company creation

When you follow the [company creation](/spend-insights/guides/manage-relationships#add-a-new-company) flow and click the **Add company** button after filling out the company details, you will see the information request window pop up. It is used to onboard your client and request access their financial data. 

Select the **Spend analysis** tickbox to ask your client for accounts payable and supplier information to the level of individual transactions, payment methods, terms, etc. You can also choose to request **Financials**, which include a profit and loss statement and a balance sheet statement enriched with our [categorization](/lending/features/financial-statements-overview#categorized-financial-accounts) feature.

Next, click **Request**. This will display an email preview that will be sent to the contact email address you listed for the company. Click **Request information** to confirm the sending of the email. 

You will see a confirmation message once the email is sent. Alternatively, you can click **Cancel**. This will take you back to the Relationship Portal, where you can always request the financial data at a later stage.

#### Request data after company creation

You can also choose to request the company's financial data at a later stage if you have not done that during company creation. 

To do so, locate the client's company in the Relationship Portal and click the **Request information** button. Alternatively, click the triple-dot menu and select **Request information** there.

## Manage existing companies

### Assign an existing company

If you have previously created companies with Codat, they are available in the Relationship Portal for you to assign to the right analyst. 

By default, the Portal displays companies that are assigned to you. To find unassigned companies or those assigned to other analysts, remove the user selection filter. Click **Users**, scroll through the dropdown list, and untick your name. 

![An image of the Relationship Portal interface with the Users option highlighted](/img/spend-insights/0061-se-rm-portal-user-list.png)

This will display an unfiltered list of companies. Then, scroll to the company you want to assign to someone, or use the search bar to find it. Next, click the triple-dot menu and select **Edit company details**. 

![An image of the Relationship Portal interface with the edit company details option visible](/img/spend-insights/0059-se-rm-portal-edit-menu.png)

In the pop-up window, scroll to the **Users** section and use the dropdown list to choose and assign analysts to the company. When you are ready, click **Save company details**. 

### Edit a company's details

You may want to edit details already stored for a company. To do that, find the relevant company in the list, click the triple-dot menu and select **Edit company details**. 

![An image of the Relationship Portal interface with the edit company details option visible](/img/spend-insights/0059-se-rm-portal-edit-menu.png)

You will see a pop-up window with the following sections:

- **Company info**: use it to change the company name and description.
- **Contact details**: use it to amend the name and email of the company's point of contact.
- **Users**: use it to assign different analysts to be responsible for the company from a dropdown list.

Update the details as required. When you are ready, click **Save company details**.

### Delete a company

If you no longer require a company to be available in the Relationship Portal, you can delete it. This action will delete the company record and all the data you previously received from it. As a result, you will no longer be able to access this company's reports in the Portal. This operation is not reversible.

To do that, find the relevant company in the list, click the triple-dot menu and select **Delete company**. 

![An image of the Relationship Portal user interface with five companies listed as examples and the Add company button highlighted](/img/spend-insights/0055-se-rm-portal-delete-company.png)

You'll need to confirm you want to delete the company. The Relationship Portal will confirm the deletion with a success message.
