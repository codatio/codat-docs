You will manage your customer and their spend insights using the dashboard available on the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io). Follow the guidelines below to create and manage your account and password with Codat.

## Register account

To get started, you will receive an email from `no-reply@mail.codat.io` with an invitation to join your organization's Codat instance. Click the joining link and complete these steps: 

1. Enter the email address in the **Email** field. This will be your Codat login email.
2. Create a password and enter it in the **Password** field.
3. Enter your full name in the **Full name** field and complete your registration.

You will be immediately redirected to the Spend Insights dashboard of the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io). We recommend saving it as a bookmark so you can easily access it later. 

Depending on your role, you will be able to perform the following actions in the Portal: 

- Create a customer
- Send a data sharing request to the customer
- Download the Spend Analysis file
