Our integrations with <a class="external" href="https://plaid.com/" target="_blank">Plaid</a>, <a  class="external" href="https://truelayer.com/" target="_blank">TrueLayer</a>, and <a class="external" href="https://basiq.io/" target="_blank">Basiq</a> enable you to retrieve up-to-date account and transaction data from your SMB customers' banks. Note that only one of these integrations can be enabled at a time.

For details about the types of banking data you can pull, see the [Banking API data model](/data-model/banking).

To view and compare banking data coverage by integration, use the <a  class="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/banking?view=tab-by-data-type&integrationKey=evqv&dataType=bankAccounts" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a> and select the **Banking API** product.

## Banking sandbox

For testing and evaluation, you can use our Banking Sandbox integration to explore the data you can work with. This doesn't need any setup apart from enabling the integration itself.

## Access additional banking data through proxy

You can [access additional banking data types](/integrations/banking/proxy-access-banking-data) through a proxy.

## Set up a banking integration

You can choose to enable:

- [Plaid](/integrations/banking/plaid/banking-plaid)
- [TrueLayer](/integrations/banking/truelayer/banking-truelayer)
- [Basiq](/integrations/banking/basiq/banking-basiq-setup) (AU and NZ clients only)

You'll need to register with your chosen provider before you can access banking data from their platform via our integration.
