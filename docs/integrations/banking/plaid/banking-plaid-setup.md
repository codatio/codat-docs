Before you can access your SMB customers' banking data from Plaid in Codat, you need to set up your integration.

You'll need to:

- Create your Plaid account, and test with the sandbox environment.
- Request access to the Plaid production environment and get your secure credentials.
- Request access to the Codat Portal.
- Add your secure credentials to the Codat Portal.
- Enable your Plaid integration.

:::note Plaid account details

- If you already have a Plaid account, have your account details to hand.

- If you don't, <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup" target="_blank">create an account</a> before you start the setup process.

:::

## Configure your Plaid application

1. Go to [Plaid's Website](https://plaid.com), choose "Get API Keys", and log in if required.
2. On the welcome page, select **Team Settings > API** from the top menu bar
3. On the "Allowed redirect URIs", choose the configure option. You will need to enter `https://plaid.codat.io/oauth/callback`. You may be prompted for your password when you save.
4. On the left hand menu select the **Keys** page.
5. Make a note of your Sandbox and Development Keys, and your Client ID.

## Add your secure credentials to the Codat Portal

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://app.codat.io/signin" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>.

2. On the navigation bar, select **Settings > Integrations > Banking**.

3. Click **Set up** on the **Plaid** tile.  
   The **Integration settings** page for Plaid is displayed.

4. Locate the secure keys that you retrieved earlier and enter the following values:

   - **client_id** value into **Client ID**.
   - **Sandbox** secret value into **Sandbox secret**.
   - **Development** secret value into **Development secret**.

5. From the **Environment** list, select **Sandbox**.

6. Enter country codes for the countries that you operate in, and want to allow your customers to link from. This filters the list of banks in the Link authorization flow to only banks in the selected countries, which might improve your conversion rate. Enter a comma-separated list of one or more of the following codes:

   ```
   US,CA,ES,FR,GB,IE,NL
   ```

   If no country codes are entered then all the above country codes are used by default. In the Plaid Sandbox and Development environments the default values are also `US,CA,ES,FR,GB,IE,NL`.

7. Select how you want to access company data, and whether you want to continuously sync data or only perform a one-off data sync when the company authorizes their connection.

8. Click **Save**.

9. Return to **Settings > Integrations > Banking**.

10. **Plaid** should now be enabled. You can click the toggle next to **Plaid** to toggle the integration between **Enabled** and **Disabled**.

## Customize the Plaid Link journey (optional)

Plaid allows you to customize the look, feel, and content of the link flow that customers see when they authorize access to their banking data. You can create and publish a customized journey in Plaid, then connect it to Codat. This is the customer experience you’ll follow during testing and production.

1. Log in to the **Plaid Dashboard** and go to [**Platform > Link > Link customization**](https://dashboard.plaid.com/link).
2. Create a new configuration or select an existing one by clicking the dropdown.

   Make a note of the **Name** you assign to the configuration and the **Countries** you select as you will need these later in Codat.
3. Configure the journey to match your needs: adjust branding, institution options, and account selection options as required. For a full list of available customization options, see Plaid’s [Link customization documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/link/customization/).
4. Click **Publish changes** to save and apply your customizations.
5. In the Codat Portal, navigate to [**Settings > Integrations > Banking > Plaid**](https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/banking/manage/suuo?integrationName=Plaid).
   - Enter the **country code(s)** for the countries you selected in step 2.
   - Enter the **Link configuration name** you created or selected in step 2.
   - Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Once complete, your customized Plaid Link journey will be applied to the banking data connection flow powered by Codat.

### Select bank accounts

When a customer connects their bank account using Plaid, they can choose which accounts to share with you. By default, all available accounts are selected. You can customize this behavior in Plaid to let customers choose specific accounts instead.

1. In the **Plaid Dashboard**, navigate to [**Platform > Link > Link customization**](https://dashboard.plaid.com/link).
2. Select [**Account Select**](https://dashboard.plaid.com/link/account-select) in the right-hand menu.
3. To allow your customers to choose which accounts to share, select **Enable for multiple accounts**.

4. Click **Publish changes** to save and apply your changes.

Once complete, Plaid will only share the accounts explicitly selected by your customers, and only those accounts will be passed to you via Codat.

## Enable production access

When you are ready to connect to live data, you will need to request access from Plaid.

1. Log in to the [**Plaid Dashboard**](https://dashboard.plaid.com/link).
2. Select **Migrate to Production** and follow the process to request access to the Plaid production environment, and to get your secure credentials.
3. Once you have your Production Secret, enter it in the box for the Production Secret within the Plaid configuration page in the Codat Portal.
4. Please note that the Country Codes default value in Plaid's Production environment is the following: `US,CA`.
