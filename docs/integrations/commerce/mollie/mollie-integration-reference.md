## Field coverage for supported data types

Codat's data model supports a wide range of fields within each data type.

Sometimes a provider's API does not grant access to a field that exists in a Codat data type. Conversely, our data model sometimes does not support all the relevant fields on an object in a provider's API.

The following table highlights selected fields that are not available in data pulled from Mollie.

### Unavailable Codat fields

|Mollie record and field|Codat data type|Status|
|----|----|----|
|`Settlements.status`|[Transactions](/commerce-api#/schemas/transactions)|The transaction status in Codat does not reflect `open` or `pending` settlements in Mollie.|
|`Payments.method`|[Payments](/commerce-api#/schemas/payments) `Payments.method.type`|Only the `creditcard` and `paypal` payment methods are reflected in Codat. All other payment methods are shown as `Custom`.|
