<p><a className="external" href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/" target="_blank">BigCommerce</a> is a SaaS-based ecommerce platform for retailers of various sizes, both B2C and B2B.</p>

With Codat's BigCommerce integration, you can securely connect to, retrieve, and view your SMB customers' commerce transactions from BigCommerce. Data is standardized to our data model and available through our [Commerce API](/commerce-api/commerce-data-types/).

## Data type coverage

View the coverage of our BigCommerce integration in the <a className="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-integration&integrationKey=vqzp" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a>.

For more information about the supported data types, see [BigCommerce integration reference](/integrations/commerce/bigcommerce/commerce-bigcommerce-integration-reference).

## Sandbox stores

Before sending Link URLs to your SMB customers, we recommend that you [test the integration](/integrations/commerce/bigcommerce/commerce-bigcommerce-test) using sample data from a sandbox store. You must be a Technology Partner to create a sandbox store and add sample data to it. For more information, refer to the following articles in the BigCommerce Dev Center:

- <a className="external" href="https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/ZG9jOjIyMDYxOQ-becoming-a-partner" target="_blank">Becoming a Partner</a>
- <a className="external" href="https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/ZG9jOjM4MzMyNTE-create-a-sandbox-store" target="_blank">Create a Sandbox Store</a>

Note that trial stores expire after 15 days and can't be populated with sample data.

## Supported plans

Our BigCommerce integration supports the following plans: Standard, Plus, Pro, Enterprise, and Essentials. You can retrieve commerce data from merchants who are signed up to a supported plan.

## Set up the integration

After you've tested the integration, see [Set up the BigCommerce integration](/integrations/commerce/bigcommerce/commerce-bigcommerce-setup) to learn how to enable your SMB customers to connect their commerce data using Link.
