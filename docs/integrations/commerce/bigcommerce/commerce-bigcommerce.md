<a className="external" href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/" target="_blank">
  BigCommerce
</a> is a SaaS-based ecommerce platform for retailers of various sizes, both B2C
and B2B.

With Codat's BigCommerce integration, you can securely connect to, retrieve, and view your SMB customers' commerce transactions from BigCommerce. Data is standardized to our data model and available through our [Commerce API](/data-model/commerce/).

## Data type coverage

View the coverage of our BigCommerce integration in the <a className="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-integration&integrationKey=vqzp" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a>.

For more information about the supported data types, see [BigCommerce integration reference](/commerce-bigcommerce-integration-reference).

## Sandbox stores

Before sending Link URLs to your SMB customers, we recommend that you [test the integration](/commerce-bigcommerce-test) using sample data from a sandbox store. You must be a Technology Partner to create a sandbox store and add sample data to it. For more information, refer to the following articles in the BigCommerce Dev Center:
