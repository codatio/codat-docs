Codat recommends that you test your integration before sending link URLs to customers.

When you've [set up your SumUp integration](/integrations/commerce/sumup/set-up-sumup-in-production-1), you're ready to test the authorization process for your integration. You'll need to:

- Set up a test company in the <a href="https://app.codat.io/" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>.
- Create a corresponding test app in SumUp.
- Generate a Link URL to connect your test company to your test app in SumUp.
- Retrieve commerce data.

## Set up a test company

1. Go to the Codat Portal where you've enabled your integration and log in.
2. Go to **Companies**.
3. On the right side of the page, click **Add new company**.
4. Enter a name for your test company and select **Add**.
5. Keep the **Companies** page open in a separate browser tab. You'll need it for the next stage of the process.

## Create a test app in SumUp

2. Add products, set their prices, and make some payments.

## Generate a link URL and connect your test company to your SumUp app

2. In the navigation bar, select **Companies**, and then select the test company that you created.
