  Recurly
</a> is a subscription billing management platform that enables merchants to streamline
their recurring billing and subscription payment processes.

Use Codat's Commerce API with Recurly to securely connect to, retrieve, and view your customers’ recurring sales and subscription transactions.

The Recurly integration is part of the [Domain Discovery Program](/integrations/commerce/domain-discovery-program), so it doesn't yet expose any standardized commerce data types. Please contact your Account Manager or Account Executive to find out more and gain access.

## Data type coverage

Because this integration is part of the Domain Discovery Program, it does not yet expose any standardized commerce data types.
