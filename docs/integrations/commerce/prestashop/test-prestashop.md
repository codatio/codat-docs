2. Go to **Companies**.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Add new company**

5. Paste the link URL into your browser, which takes you to the Codat Link UI.
6. Choose **PrestaShop** and then **Continue to PrestaShop**.
7. Configure your PrestaShop instance and retrieve your PrestaShop Webservice Key (youâ€™ll find steps for how to do this when navigating to PrestaShop through the Link UI).
8. Enter your PrestaShop web address and Webservice Key in the Link UI.

## Retrieve sample commerce data

To make sure that commerce data has been pulled successfully into the Codat Portal:

1. Go to the Codat Portal where you've enabled your integration.
2. In the navigation bar, select **Companies**, and then select the test company that you created.
3. Select **Data > Commerce** to see data for all Commerce data types.
4. If no data is displayed, click **Refresh data**. You can also view **Pull history** to check the status of previous data syncs.
