Before you can access your customers' commerce data from PrestaShop, you need to set up a live integration.

You'll need to:

- Enable your PrestaShop integration in the Codat Portal.
- Check your sync settings.

## Enable the PrestaShop integration

1. In the Codat Portal, go to the <a className="external" href="https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/commerce" target="blank">**Commerce integrations**</a> page.
2. Locate **PrestaShop** and click the toggle to enable the integration.

You can also click **Manage** to view the integration's settings page, and then enable the integration from there.

## Check your sync settings in the Codat Portal

If this is your first commerce integration, update your [data type settings](/integrations/commerce/commerce-sync-settings) to enable commerce data types.
