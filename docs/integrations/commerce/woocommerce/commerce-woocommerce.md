:::caution Add-ons and versions

WooCommerce is an open-source platform built for configurability. A large part of its success is its wide-ranging add-on library featuring extensions from third-party developers. Codat strives to add support for major add-ons where possible, but be aware that in some cases it's not possible to successfully retrieve data from merchants with unsupported add-ons.
