[WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) is a customizable, open-source eCommerce software built on WordPress.

Use Codat's Commerce API with WooCommerce to securely connect to, retrieve, and view your customers' commerce transactions.

## Set up the integration

See [Set up the WooCommerce integration](/integrations/commerce/woocommerce/commerce-woocommerce-setup) to learn how to set up and enable the integration.

:::caution Add-ons and versions

WooCommerce is an open-source platform built for configurability. A large part of its success is its wide-ranging add-on library featuring extensions from third-party developers. Codat strives to add support for major add-ons where possible, but be aware that in some cases it's not possible to successfully retrieve data from merchants with unsupported add-ons.
