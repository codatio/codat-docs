Zoho Books is a global accounting package with customers in the UK, US, Australia, India, and South Africa.

Before you can access data from customers using Zoho Books for their accounting, you need to set up a Zoho Books integration in the Codat Portal. You'll need to:

- Register your Zoho Books application.
- Add the secure keys generated by your registration to the Codat Portal.
- Enable your Zoho Books integration in the Codat Portal.

Codat recommends that you test your integration before sending Link URLs to customers.

:::note Supported versions

Codat currently supports the UK and US regions only for Zoho Books.
:::

:::note Zoho Books rate limits

Codat works within the rate limits set by Zoho Books to minimize the impact on data syncs. By default, line items are excluded when retrieving invoices and credit notes. For customers, address and contact information is excluded.

See [Zoho Books limits and reduced data pulls](/integrations/accounting/zoho-books/zoho-book-limits) to understand more about how Zoho Books controls the volume of data your organization can retrieve, and the number of data connections per organization.

If you already have a Zoho Books account, have your account details to hand. If you don't, [create an account](https://www.zoho.com/developer/signup.html) before you start registration.

To register your Zoho Books application.

1. Go to <https://api-console.zoho.com/> and sign in to Zoho Books. If you are using your account for the first time, select **GET STARTED**.  
   The **Developer Console** is displayed. If the **Applications** screen is displayed instead, from the top-left corner, select **ADD CLIENT**.
2. Select **Server-based Applications**.  
   The **Create New Client** page is displayed.
3. Add the following details:
   - From the **Client Type** list, select **Server-based Applications**.

   - In the **Homepage URL** box, enter your company's website address.
   - In the **Authorized redirect URIs** box, enter `https://zohobooks.codat.io/oauth/callback`
4. Click **Create**.  
   Zoho Books generates the secure keys that you'll need for the next stage of the process.
5. When the page refreshes with the **Client Secret** tab selected, either:
   - Keep this page open in a separate browser tab.
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to a Word document or similar.
6. Select the **Settings** tab and enable any of the listed regions where your customers are based.
