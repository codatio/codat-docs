Zoho Books is a global accounting software with customers in the UK, US, Australia, India, and South Africa.

Before you can access data from customers using Zoho Books for their accounting, you need to set up a Zoho Books integration in the Codat Portal. You'll need to:

- Register your Zoho Books application.
- Add the secure keys generated by your registration to the Codat Portal.
- Enable your Zoho Books integration in the Codat Portal.

Codat recommends that you test your integration before sending Link URLs to customers.

:::note Supported versions

Codat currently supports the UK and US regions only for Zoho Books.

:::note Zoho Books rate limits

Codat works within the rate limits set by Zoho Books to minimize the impact on data syncs. By default, line items are excluded when retrieving invoices and credit notes. For customers, address and contact information is excluded.

See [Zoho Books limits and reduced data reads](zoho-book-limits) to understand more about how Zoho Books controls the volume of data your organization can retrieve, and the number of data connections per organization.
