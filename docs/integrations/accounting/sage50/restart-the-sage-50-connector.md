In some circumstances, your users might want to restart their Sage 50 connector. For example, they might have syncs in progress that were interrupted by a technical issue.

The **Restart connector** link in the connector UI is disabled by default. Codat Support can enable the link to allow your users to restart the connector, if needed.

If restarted, the connector automatically:

- Cancels data syncs in progress for all the companies managed using the connector.
- Shuts down the connector.
- Restarts the connector.

## Enable the restart connector link

Codat's Support team needs to enable the **Restart connector** link for your user. To do so, they'll need the ID of the user's connector.

To obtain the connector ID from your user, please ask them to:

1. Open their Sage 50 connector.
2. Select the **About** link at the bottom of the connector window.

3. Select the **Copy** icon next to the **Connector Id**.

/>

4. Paste their connector ID into a document or email and send it to you.

You can then send the connector ID to the Codat Support team by raising a ticket through the [support request form](https://codat.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new). They will confirm when the **Restart connector** link has been enabled.
