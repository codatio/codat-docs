## Initial setup

Before your SMB users can download and install the on-premise connector, you'll need to perform the following tasks in the Codat Portal.

### 1. Add your branding

Add your company branding: this is used in the link flow and in the connector app.

From the SMB user's perspective, they'll see the connector app as being owned and branded by you, rather than by Codat.

### 2. Configure the link flow

You can choose to configure the built-in Codat link flow for the connector. This will create a download link for the connector and provide the unique company ID (used as the license key) for each of your SMB users.

Here's how that looks to your users:

![](/img/old/c266e47-qbd-connector_download-page-end-of-link-flow.png)

Alternatively, you can choose to build this functionality yourself using the Codat API. This involves calling the QuickBooks Desktop connector download endpoint (provided in the data connection response) and the customer ID. This allows you to maintain the look and feel of your company's brand, or to implement a specific workflow.

### 3. Enable the connector

Enable the QuickBooks Desktop connector in the <a className="external" href="https://app.codat.io/" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>.

1. Select **Settings > Integrations > Accounting**.
2. Click **Set up** next to **QuickBooks Desktop**.
3. Select the toggle to set the integration to **Enabled**.

## SMB user flow

Here's how your SMB users interact with the QBD connector.

- The SMB user downloads the connector as part of the link flow.
- The user needs administrator privileges (admin rights) to run the connector installer. Alternatively, a different administrator can approve the installation and run the connector.
- The SMB user completes some simple steps to complete the installation (as described in [Install the QuickBooks Desktop connector](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/installing-the-quickbooks-connector)). In summary, they'll need to:
  - Enter their unique license number (their Codat Company ID), which is provided during the link flow.
  - Complete some steps to point the connector at the correct accounting software data file on their local machine.

When installed, the QBD connector doesnâ€™t require any further interaction by the SMB user, and administrator privileges are no longer required.

The connector has a UI that is accessible from the system tray. Your SMB users do not usually need to interact with this, but there is functionality available for advanced users, such as adding connections to multiple companies, pausing syncs, and manually starting syncs.
