You can synchronize accounting data with <a className="external" href="https://www.freshbooks.com/" target="_blank">FreshBooks</a> using our FreshBooks integration.

## Supported versions

FreshBooks Classic organizations are not supported. FreshBooks Classic is a legacy version of FreshBooks and uses a different API.

## Set up the integration

Before you can access data from your customers who use FreshBooks for their accounting, you need to set up the FreshBooks integration.

You'll need to:

- Create a FreshBooks application.
- Add the application's secure keys to the Codat Portal.

### Create a FreshBooks application

Create and configure an application in the FreshBooks Developer Portal.

1. Log in to <a className="external" href="https://www.freshbooks.com" target="_blank">freshbooks.com</a>.

   If you don't already have an account, you can create one by clicking **Try it Free**.

2. On the Dashboard, click the cog icon and then select **Developer Portal**.

   The <a className="external" href="https://my.freshbooks.com/#/developer" target="_blank">Apps</a> page in the Developer Portal is displayed.

3. Click **Create New App**.

4. Enter the following information into the boxes on the **Create Application** page:

   - **Application Name**: Enter a name for your application. This is displayed to your users when they authorize your access to their accounting data, so choose a name that clearly identifies your organization.

   - **Application Type**: Select **Private App**.

   - **Scopes**: Add the required _read_ and _write_ scopes listed in [FreshBooks application scopes](/integrations/accounting/freshbooks/accounting-freshbooks#freshbooks-application-scopes).

   - **Redirect URIs**: Enter `https://freshbooks.codat.io/oauth/callback` then click the check mark icon to save the URI.

5. Click **Save** to create your app.

6. Select your new app from the **All Apps** list. Locate the app's **Client ID** and **Client Secret** at the bottom of the page.

### FreshBooks application scopes

The following table lists the recommended scopes to set for your FreshBooks application. If the scopes you require change in future, all connected companies will need to reauthenticate with your app.

:::caution _Read_ and _write_ scopes
The table outlines the minimum scopes needed to allow _read_ access to the FreshBooks objects that are supported by Codat. If you want to create, update or delete data in FreshBooks, you need to select the corresponding _write_ scopes for the relevant objects.
