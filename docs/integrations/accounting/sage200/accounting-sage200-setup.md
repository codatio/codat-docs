## Set up Sage 200 Standard

:::caution Changes in authenticating integrations

Sage has recently modified the way applications and integrations are authenticated in Sage 200 API. You can find out more about the changes in <a href="https://gb-kb.sage.com/portal/app/portlets/results/viewsolution.jsp?solutionid=201204115644533" target="_blank">Sage 200 API - Guide to Sage ID Changes</a>.

If you're a Codat **customer who already has an account** with Sage, please refer to section [Request new credentials](/integrations/accounting/sage200/accounting-sage200-setup#section-request-new-credentials) below. **Customers who need to set up their Sage accounts** are requested to follow the process described below.
:::

Before you can access data from customers using Sage 200 Standard for their accounting, you need to set up a Sage 200 Standard integration in the Codat Portal. You'll need to:

- Request an account from Sage and obtain API credentials.
- Wait for Sage to send through your secure keys.
- Retrieve a subscription and signing key from the Sage API site.
- Add your secure keys to the Codat Portal.

## Request an account and obtain API credentials

1. Request an account from Sage by filling out the <a href="https://sage.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2fRebFy4s4PWLmC" target="_blank">Sage Developer Services API - Request an Account</a> form. Provide the required details and choose _Sage 200 Standard API_ as the application you are developing for.
2. Once your account has been created you will receive an email from Sage with a link to a my.sage.co.uk page, where you can sign in to get your account number under My account > My accounts.
3. Request your API credentials by filling out the <a href="https://sage.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bQ14AM1zXki0msm" target="_blank">Sage 200 API Credential Request Form</a>.  
   When your API credentials have been generated, Sage will email your Client ID and Secret to you.

_Note_: When submitting the Sage 200 API Credential Request Form:

- Request the maximum expiry time for the refresh token, namely 90 days.
- Request via the form for each environment for which you require credentials.
- For the question 'Desktop or Web Application' select '_Web_'.
- For the question 'Redirect URL(s)' enter: `https://sage200cloud.codat.io/oauth/callback` for Production.

2. Locate **Sage 200 Standard** and click the toggle to enable the integration.

You can also click **Manage** to view the integration's settings page, and then enable the integration from there.

Your Sage 200 Standard integration is now set up.

## Test your integration

We recommend that you test your integration before sending Link URLs to customers. You'll need your own Sage 200 Standard account to do this.

:::note Sage 200 Standard trial accounts

Unfortunately, you can't use a trial account to test your integration. Sage doesn't allow the creation or update of records from their trial accounts.
:::

1. Set up some test data in your Sage 200 Standard account. For example, some new or amended invoices.
2. Next, go to the Codat Portal where you've enabled your integration and [create a test company](/configure/portal/companies#add-a-new-company).
3. Find the Link URL for your test company. Select **Request data** next to the company name.
4. Use the Link URL to connect your Sage 200 Standard account.
   - When Link opens, select **Sage 200 Standard**, and then select **Continue to Sage 200 Standard**.
   - Log in to your Sage 200 Standard account.
   - Authorize access to your account details.
5. Make sure that test data from your account is displayed for your test company in the Codat Portal.

## Request new credentials

If you already have a Sage Developer account, you won't need to register an account and can just request credentials. To request credentials:

1. Sign in to your account on <a href="https://sage.co.uk/" target="_blank">My Sage</a> page and go to ‘My Accounts’ where you can find your account number.
2. Fill out the <a href="https://sage.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bQ14AM1zXki0msm" target="_blank">Sage 200 API Credential Request Form</a> to request new API credentials.
3. Retrieve subscription key by subscribing to the Sage 200 API on the <a href="https://developer.columbus.sage.com/products/" target="_blank">Sage 200 API</a> page for developers.
4. When your API credentials have been generated, Sage will provide Client ID and secret via email.

_Note_: When submitting the Sage 200 API Credential Request Form:

- Request the maximum expiry time for the refresh token, namely 90 days.
- Request via the form for each environment for which you require credentials.
- For the question 'Desktop or Web Application' select '_Web_'.
- For the question 'Redirect URL(s)' enter: `https://sage200cloud.codat.io/oauth/callback`

:::caution Balance sheets in Sage 200's sandbox data

If you link a Codat test company to one of the Sage sandbox accounts, the balance sheet dataset will fail to sync, and shows the status `ValidationError`. This is because the dataset fails Codat's checks, which make sure that a balance sheet balances, that is, net assets are equal to equity.
:::

:::note Tax rates on line items
Due to a Sage 200 Standard limitation, tax rates on line items for invoices, credit notes, bills, and bill credit notes appear differently to other integrations. For more information, see [Sage 200 Standard limitations](/integrations/accounting/sage200/sage200-limitations).
