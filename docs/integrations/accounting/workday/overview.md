You can leverage the actionable vendor and spend activity insights of our [Spend Insights](/spend-insights/overview) solution based on the accounts payable data from our <a className="external" href="https://www.workday.com/" target="_blank">Workday</a> integration.

Workday is a financial management, human capital management, and student information system software provider aimed at the middle-market segment.

## Getting started

No set up is required to start using Workday. Enable Workday in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) to connect data from your first Workday customers.

If you require a test Workday instance, youâ€™ll need to go through Workday's partnership program, which includes extensive training as part of the approval process. Reach out to your Codat account manager to discuss this.

### Enable the Workday integration

1. In the Codat Portal, go to the <a className="external" href="https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/accounting" target="blank">**Accounting integrations**</a> page.
2. Locate **Workday** and click the toggle to enable the integration.

You can also click **Manage** to view the integration's settings page, and then enable the integration from there.
