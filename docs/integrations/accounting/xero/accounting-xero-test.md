When you've set up your Xero integration, you're ready to test the authorization process by connecting a company to test data in Xero. Codat recommends that you do this before sending any Link URLs to your customers.

To test your integration, you'll need to:

- Set up a test company in the Codat Portal.
- Create a demo company in Xero.
- Generate a Link URL.
- Using Link, try out the process of connecting your test company to your demo company in Xero.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you've [set up your Xero integration](/integrations/accounting/xero/accounting-xero-setup).

## Create a demo Xero company

1. Log in to <a href="https://xero.com" target="_blank">Xero</a> using the credentials for your developer account.

2. Follow the instructions in <a href="https://central.xero.com/s/article/Use-the-demo-company" target="_blank"> Use the demo company</a> to access or create a demo company.

## Create a company and link it to Xero

Create a test company in the Codat Portal and connect it to your demo Xero company.

1. In the navigation bar, select **Companies**, then click **New company**.

2. Enter a name for your test company, such as `xero-test`, then click **Add**. Copy the **Link URL** for your test company.

3. Enter the Link URL into a browser. Link for your integration is displayed.

## Viewing test data from Xero in Codat

View test data from the Xero demo company in the Codat Portal.

1. Go to the **Companies** page and select the test company you created earlier and linked with Xero.

2. View the test data from Xero under the **Accounting** tab.

If you don't see any test data, you can check whether the sync completed successfully. From the **Companies** page, click **Read history**. Also, check that the supported data types are set to **Fetch on first link** in **Settings > Data types**.

## What's next?

Next, you might want to:

- Edit your sync settings to change which data types to read from Xero.
- Try out the Write API to create or edit data within Xero.
