## Lending Partners

<aside>
⚠️ App Partnership is currently only available to lenders operating in specific countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. 

Lenders operating in the US, Canada and Ireland are currently unable to become Xero App Partners.

</aside>

 To become a Lending App Partner you must:

- Implement ‘lending write-back’ (see below)
- Set up a Commercial Agreement with Xero.
- Comply with all the relevant Certification Checkpoints.

If possible, we recommend progressing both the commercial and technical aspects of App Partnership in parallel to avoid unnecessary delays.

**Lending write-back**

Xero has one unique technical requirement for lenders. 

The goal of the write back is to maintain the financial position in Xero for the customer at any point of the lending cycle. This will be achieved by recording the loan liability, the interest and/or fees, repayments, and facilitating the reconciliation of bank accounts.

[You can read Xero’s developer documentation on write-back here](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/general-lending-integration-guide/). 

<aside>
💡 We recommend that you work closely with your Codat account team to implement write-back for detailed guidance specific to the type of lending you do.

</aside>

**Commercial Agreement for Lending Partners**

The commercial terms of this agreement are between you as a lender and Xero. Codat is not involved in the negotiation of that commercial agreement.
