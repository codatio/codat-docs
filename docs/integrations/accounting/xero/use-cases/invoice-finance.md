Introduction
Selective Invoice Financing

As part of their App Partner process Xero requires invoice finance providers to handle the write back process to maintain the financial position for customer during the lending cycle.

This functionality needs to be built by the client into their application, giving their customers the option to enable the continuous publishing of relevant transactions to Xero.

Key considerations:

The data flow is optional, so should come with the ability to switch on/off

The customer should be able to configure their account mapping and have the ability to update at any time.

0. Prerequisite

The user will need to configure their mapping prior to any successful write operation. We recommend a configuration page that they can access at any time. Example:
