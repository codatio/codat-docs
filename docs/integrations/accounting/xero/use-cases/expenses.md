Introduction

In order to meet the requirements of Xero App Partner Program for financial services and provide a complete reconciliation process, the approach for integration has two sides - Xero transactions and Bank reconciliation.

Xero transactions

To complete reconciliation the bank transactions must be reconciled against Xero transactions.

Xero transactions include:

Invoices and payments - sales paid at a later date

Bills and bill payments - purchase due at a later date

Spend money transactions - everyday purchases

Receive money transaction - everyday sales or refunds

Bank reconciliation

As described by Xero, bank reconciliation is the process to confirm that all the transactions in your bank accounts are recorded in your business accounting records.

This is achieved by matching bank statement lines from a bank or bank like source (left), against Xero transactions (right).

Bank statement lines are the bank transactions imported from your bank account via a bank feed or they’re manually imported. When they’re in your online banking, they’re referred to as bank transactions, then when they’re imported into Xero we call them bank statement lines.

Transactions are created in Xero. These could be invoices, bills, expense claims or cash transactions.
