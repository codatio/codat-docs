To receive Xero App Store Partner certification you must comply with Xero's certification checkpoints. You can review these in detail in Xero's [own documentation](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/xero-app-store/app-partner-guides/certification-checkpoints/). 

This is a companion guide on how to comply. We strongly recommend that you discuss Xero compliance with your Codat implementation specialist before you start work on any of the points below.

## Certification Checkpoints

### 1. Sign up with Xero

**Action required: significant**

All apps seeking certification must create a unique user journey to take potential customers from the Xero App Store to your app. The purpose of creating this unique journey is two-fold:
1)	To create a quick and easy user experience for Xero users
2)	To enable Xero to track which Xero users discover your app in the Xero App Store.

(2) is important because Xero charges a 15% referral fee for referrals generated by their App Store.  but does not monetise Xero connections that originate through your other customer acquisition channels.
You can use [this guide](/integrations/accounting/xero/partner-certification/sign-up-with-xero) to decide which type of Sign Up with Xero journey to build – and how to do it with Codat.

### 2. Xero App Store

**Action required: minimal or significant**

The amount of work required to comply with this checkpoint depends on the nature of your app. Xero’s bullet points are:
•	Enter in your Billing Details
•	Create and submit your App Listing for review
•	Implement App Store Subscriptions

The first two bullet points are purely administrative and do not take long to complete. The third bullet point requires engineering work to comply, if you operate in UK, Australia and New Zealand and have a commercial model that fits Xero’s criteria. 

We recommend that you speak with your Codat account team to check whether you should implement Commercial Billing or App Store Subscriptions before you take action. 

### 3. Connection

**Action required: significant**

While Codat handles the initial connection to Xero via the Codat Link UI, Xero requires that you enable your user to manage this connection on an ongoing basis. Best practice is to create an ‘Integration Settings’ to satisfy these requirements.

| Requirement | Recommendations |
| :-- | :-- |
| Display the name of the tenant that has been connected | This can be retrieved from our [Get company info](/accounting-api#/operations/get-company-info) endpoint. |
| Display the current status of the connection. If disconnected, provide a button to reconnect to Xero | Use our [Get connection](/platform-api#/operations/get-company-connection) endpoint to check the `status` of the connection and use the `linkUrl` to reconnect|
| Provide a button to terminate the connection | When a user clicks on the button, use our [Unlink connection](/platform-api#/operations/unlink-connection) endpoint to disconnect from Xero. |
| Handle a disconnect from Xero's side | Use our [Data connection status changed](/using-the-api/webhooks/core-rules-types#company-data-connection-status-changed) webhook to identify when a disconnect happens. When the alert is triggered, change the connection status in your UI and display a "Reconnect" or "Connect" button. Xero recommends setting a regular daily sync of light data types so you can check each connected company's connection status every day.|
| Support one-to-one or multi-organizational connection | Codat allows your customers to select their Xero organization using the native Xero UI. You can enable them to connect to multiple organizations within Xero by creating a separate Codat company per organization. |
| Provide a disconnection process for off-boarding | Use our [Unlink connection](/platform-api#/operations/unlink-connection) endpoint to prevent further syncs or the [Delete connection](/platform-api#/operations/delete-company-connection) endpoint to prevent further syncs and querying of historically synced data.|

### 4. Branding and Naming

**Action required: minimal**

You must be compliant with Xero's guidance wherever you mention your Xero Partnership or use their brand assets. To ensure that, review Xero's [Brand Guidelines](https://developer.xero.com/static/otherfiles/xero-app-partner-brand-guidelines.pdf) and [Branding how-to-guide](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/branding-your-integration/).

Xero recommends you use [their own](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/branding-your-integration/) _Connect_ and _Disconnect_ buttons, but you can use a standard set of buttons for consistency of style if your app has multiple integrations. 

### 5. Scopes

**Action required: minimal**

Xero requires that apps only have access to the data that they need, so you should only enable scopes required to access the data relevant to your use case. We provide [a guide](/integrations/accounting/xero/partner-certification/scopes) to explain which scopes typically correspond to which use cases. Speak with your Codat implementation specialist and they will adjust your scopes appropriately, once you have agreed what is needed.

### 6. Error handling

**Action required: moderate**

If an error occurs, your UI should communicate that fact to the user. It is best practice to provide detailed error messages or logs. Codat provides detailed error messaging for any issues with the integration, including status codes, listed in our [Status codes and errors](/using-the-api/errors).

### 7. Date Integrity

**Action required: none or minimal**

Most Codat implementations are fully compliant with this checkpoint without any additional work required. However, if your app handles multiple currencies you should verify that you are handling this appropriately.
Before creating or updating transactional data, such as a payment in another currency, use our [Get push options](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/operations/get-create-update-model-options-by-data-type) endpoint to see which currencies have been set up by your customer in Xero. Then, proceed with creating or updating that transactional data.

You can also read more about [creating, updating or deleting data](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/push) with Codat.

### 8. Account and Payment mapping

**Action required: none or significant**

This checkpoint is only relevant to some apps that create, update or delete data in Xero. 

Relevant apps must create an account mapping interface for your users. In preparation, we recommend you review Xero's [best practice guide](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/integration-best-practices) and Codat's [implementation guide](/using-the-api/best-practices/implementing-a-mapping-page).
  
### 9. Taxes

**Action required: none or minimal**

If your app handles tax, you need to ensure the correct tax rate is used on invoices, quotes, etc. 

Codat can pull tax rates as individual tax rates and on transactions, like invoices or payments. We also handle tax rate calculation when creating or updating transactions with tax rates where multiple tax components are applied to the effective tax rates (e.g. compound tax rates).

We do not currently support the creation of new tax rates, so you can only use existing rates in a SMB's Xero account. You may need to allow for mapping of tax rates in your [account mapping page](/integrations/accounting/xero/partner-certification/checkpoints-app-store#12-account-mapping).
