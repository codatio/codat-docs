To integrate with Sage Intacct, you must be a _Sage Intacct Developer Partner_, or work with an authorized partner.

Codat's enterprise clients can use our partner credentials to enable the integration if desired. Alternatively, you can register with the Sage Intacct Developer Programme and obtain your own partner credentials.

If you would like to enable our integration with Sage Intacct, please contact your Solutions Engineer to gain access to partner credentials for your instance and to discuss the process of [becoming a Sage Intacct partner](https://marketplace.intacct.com/BecomeAPartner).

:::note Entity Level access required

_Entity Level access_ must be enabled in Sage Intacct before a company can connect to the integration.
