You can choose whether the Sage 50 (UK & Ireland) and QuickBooks Desktop on-premise connectors run once only, or remain installed on your customers' machines.

Two options for connector setup are available.

- **Install on the customer's machine (default):** After the connector is installed, the customer's data is periodically updated in the Codat portal. The connector remains installed on the user's computer.
- **Do not install / one-time sync:** After data is uploaded from the customer's accounting platform, the connector removes itself from the user's computer. A one-time sync is performed when the user runs the connector.

If you opt to install the connector, you'll be able to refresh your customers' data in future, with no action required by them.

On-premise connector configuration is set in the Codat Portal at the integration level. You can override the settings for individual companies if needed.

## Configure connector setup options at the integration level

1. Open the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) and log in.
2. In the navigation bar, select **Settings > Integrations > Accounting**.
3. Find either the **QuickBooks Desktop** or **Sage 50 (UK & Ireland)** integrations and then select **Set up**.
4. Choose one of the following options:

   - **Do not install / one-time sync**
   - **Install on the customer's machine**

5. Click **Save**.
