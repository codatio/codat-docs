:::caution Change to Sage Business Cloud Accounting setup

If you set up your [Codat integration with Sage Business Cloud Accounting](/integrations/accounting/sagebusinesscloud/accounting-sagebusinesscloud) **before** October 19, 2020, you'll notice a change to the credentials page in the Codat portal. The option **Client ID, client secret, signing secret and subscription key (API v3 - UKI)** is selected for your integration.

**To continue to use version 3.0**, you don't need to make any changes. The integration will continue to work as normal. However, when you link new companies you must only select the UK or Ireland flags.

**To start using version 3.1** with extended coverage for UK, Ireland, and US, Canada, France, Germany and Spain - you'll need to add new credentials as described below. You don't need to remove your existing version 3.0 credentials or relink your existing companies. When new companies do link, they'll have access to all nationalities supported by version 3.1.

Version 3.1 also allows a customer to choose which company data file they want to link and sync if they manage different accounts from the same machine.
