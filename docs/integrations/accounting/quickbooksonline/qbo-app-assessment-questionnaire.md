## Introduction

All apps that intend to access QuickBooks Online production data must fill in a questionnaire as part of Intuit's app assessment process. Many of its questions require you to provide information about your organization and your app's use case. 

However, some questions relate to Codat's integration with QuickBooks Online. We have provided guideline responses for such questions below. They are highlighted in **bold**.

## Questionnaire

### General questions

There are no questions related to Codat in this section. Developers can answer all questions according to their own circumstances.
