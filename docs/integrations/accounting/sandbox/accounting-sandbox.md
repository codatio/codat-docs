The Codat Sandbox integration contains sample data for developers to test our integrations and develop product demos. Sandbox gives you access to all the data types and operations supported by Codat.

We've tried to make our Sandbox data as varied as possible, and the data sets provide different levels of detail. However, the data is auto-generated and its completeness and accuracy can't be guaranteed.

## Set up the integration

All Codat accounts come with access to our Sandbox integration and it should be enabled by default.

If you've disabled your Sandbox integration and you need to re-enable it, you should:

1. Sign in to the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io).
2. On the navigation bar, select **SettingsÂ > Integrations > Accounting**.
3. Find the **Sandbox** integration then use the toggle to update it from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.
