## Set up the integration

No application registration is required for the Clear Books integration to work. While linking their data, the SMB user is asked to enter their API key as shown:

To find their API key, the SMB user does the following:

1. Logs in to their Clear Books account.

2. Selects **Settings > Configure system > API keys** from the menu bar.

3. Selects **Provide required information**, then provides the following information:

   1. Under **Intended API usage**, selects the second option: **I want to connect Clear Books with a piece of third-party software, exclusively for my own use**.
   2. Under **Third-party software information**, enters the name of your app or website in the first box and "Codat" in the second box.

Their API key is now available to copy from the **API keys** page (under **SOAP API**).
