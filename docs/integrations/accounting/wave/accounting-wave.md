You can read accounting data from <a className="external" href="https://www.waveapps.com/" target="_blank">Wave</a> using our Wave integration.

## Set up the integration

Wave is a global accounting software that simplifies accounting processes for small business owners.

Before you can access data from customers using Wave for their accounting, you need to set up a Wave integration in the Codat portal. You'll need to:

- Register your Wave application on Wave's developer portal.
- Add the secure keys generated by your registration to the Codat portal.
- Enable your Wave integration in the Codat portal.

### Register your application

:::note Developer account details

- If you already have a Wave account, have your account details to hand.
- If you don't, <a href="https://my.waveapps.com/register/" target="_blank">create an account</a> before you start registration.

To register your Wave application you need to use Wave's developer portal.

1. Go to the <a href="https://developer.waveapps.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019762711" target="_blank">Wave Developer Portal</a> and sign in.  
   The **Manage Applications** page is displayed.
2. If you are using your account for the first time, select _Get Started_. Otherwise, select  
   _Create an application_.  
   The _Create an application_ section is displayed.
3. Add the following details:
   - In the _Name_ box, enter your companyâ€™s name. Your customers see this when they authorize your connection to their accounting system.
   - (Optional) In the _Description_ box, you can write a short description of the application.
   - In the _Redirect URIs_ box, enter `https://wave.codat.io/oauth/callback`
