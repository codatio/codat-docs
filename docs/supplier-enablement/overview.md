## What is it?

With our **Supplier Enablement** product, you can access your clients' accounts payable data within minutes and gain insights on their spend and supplier activity. 

Use this detail to identify suppliers eligible for your clients' virtual card programs, run targeted supplier outreach campaigns on your clients' behalf, and grow your commercial card volume in B2B payments. 

## Who is it for?

With **Supplier Enablement**, we enable banks and other commercial card issuers to make their supplier onboarding process simpler and more effective, helping them grow revenue per customer and reduce spend churn when moving banking customers to their virtual card product.
