## Overview

Our [Relationship Manager Portal](https://relationships.codat.io/) is your one-stop shop to view the clients and relationships you are responsible for. Here, your organization's clients are represented as [companies](../../terms/company). 

In this guide, we will cover the ways you can request accounts payable data from your clients and download the resulting reports. 

:::tip Your customer's journey

Once you request the information, your customer will need to go through a set of steps to allow you to see their business data in the Relationship Manager. You can learn more about this in the [Customer journey](/supplier-enablement/guides/customer-journey) guide.

## Request financial data

You can request supplier and spend data from your customer in two ways:

- [During the initial company creation](/supplier-enablement/guides/analyze-spend#request-financial-data-during-company-creation)
- [After company creation at a later stage](/supplier-enablement/guides/analyze-spend#request-financial-data-after-company-creation)

#### Request financial data during company creation

When you follow the [company creation](/supplier-enablement/guides/manage-relationships#add-a-new-company) flow and click the **Add company** button after filling out the company details, you will see the information request window pop up. It is used to onboard your client and request access their financial data. 

Select the **Spend analysis** tickbox to ask your client for accounts payable and supplier information to the level of individual transactions, payment methods, terms, etc. 

You can also choose to request **Financials**, which include a profit and loss statement and a balance sheet statement enriched with our [categorization](/lending/features/financial-statements-overview#categorized-financial-accounts) feature.

Next, click **Request**. This will display an email preview that will be sent to the contact email address you listed for the company. The content of the email will differ depending on the information type you selected. Click **Request information** to confirm the sending of the email. 

You will see a confirmation message once the email is sent.

#### Request financial data after company creation

You can also choose to request the company's financial data at a later stage if you have not done that during company creation. 

To do so, locate the client's company in the Relationship Manager and click the **Request information** button. Alternatively, click the triple-dot menu and select **Request information** there.

## Download spend data

### Check data status

When your customer receives the information request email, they will click the link in the message and go through an authorization process to allow you to access their spend details. 

Once they authorize the access, you will see their status change to _Available_. When that happens, you are ready to download the data they shared.

### Download reports

To download the Excel report that have been generated as a result of the customer sharing their data, locate your customer's company and click the button with the download icon. In the dropdown, choose the type of report you wish to download and click the corresponding line.
