## Overview

Our [Relationship Manager Portal](https://relationships.codat.io/) is your one-stop shop to view the clients and relationships you are responsible for. Here, your organization's clients are represented as [companies](../../terms/company). 

In this guide, we will cover the creation of a new company, assignment of an existing company to an analyst, and editing and deletion of company records.

## Add a new company

To create your client as a company in the Relationship Manager Portal and start the onboarding process, click the **Add a company** button.  

![An image of the Relationship Manager Portal user interface with five companies listed as examples and the Add company button highlighted](/img/supplier-enablement/0054-se-rm-portal-add-company.png)

This will open the company creation window with the following sections:

- **Company info**: use it to add the company name and description.
- **Contact details**: use it to add the name and email of the company's point of contact.
- **Users**: use it to assign different analysts to be responsible for the company from a dropdown list.

Company name and contact name and emails are mandatory fields, but you do not have to assign an analyst to the record - for example, if the client has not yet been allocated to a manager. 

When ready, click the **Add company** button. This creates a record in the Relationship Manager.

Next, you will see the information request window appear. It is used to onboard your client and request access their financial data. If you are ready to request the data, select the applicable data types and click **Request**. 

This will send an email request to the contact email address you listed for the company. The content of the email will differ depending on the information type you selected.


Alternatively, click **Cancel**. This will take you back to the Relationship Manager, where you can always request the financial data at a later stage.

We talk you through the details of both of these options in our [Check spend data](/supplier-enablement/guides/analyze-spend) guide. 

:::tip Your customer's journey

Once you request the information, your customer will need to go through a set of steps to allow you to see their business data in the Relationship Manager. You can learn more about this in the [Customer journey](/supplier-enablement/guides/customer-journey) guide.

### Multi-entity companies

If you want to request _spend analysis data_ from a customer who has multiple subsidiary companies, you don't need to create and request data for each subsidiary individually. 

When responding to your request, the customer should follow the [multi-entity connection journey](/supplier-enablement/guides/customer-journey#multi-entity-connection-journey). They will be asked to create the relevant subsidiaries and connect an accounting platform for each one during that journey. 

As a result, you will see the main legal entity and its subsidiaries in the Relationship Manager.

## Edit a company

You may want to edit details already stored for a company. To do that, find the relevant company in the list, click the triple-dot menu and select **Edit company details**. 

![An image of the Relationship Manager Portal interface with the edit company details option visible](/img/supplier-enablement/0059-se-rm-portal-edit-menu.png)

You will see a pop-up window with the following sections:

- **Company info**: use it to change the company name and description.
- **Contact details**: use it to amend the name and email of the company's point of contact.
- **Users**: use it to assign different analysts to be responsible for the company from a dropdown list.

Update the details as required. When you are ready, click **Save company details**.

## Assign an existing company

If you have previously created companies with Codat, they are available in the Relationship Manager for you to assign to the right analyst. 

By default, the Manager displays companies that are assigned to you. To find unassigned companies or those assigned to other analysts, remove the user selection filter. Click **Users**, scroll through the dropdown list, and untick your name.

This will display an unfiltered list of companies. Then, scroll to the company you want to assign to someone, or use the search bar to find it. Next, click the triple-dot menu and select **Edit company details**. 

![An image of the Relationship Manager Portal interface with the edit company details option visible](/img/supplier-enablement/0059-se-rm-portal-edit-menu.png)

In the pop-up window, scroll to the **Users** section and use the dropdown list to choose and assign analysts to the company. When you are ready, click **Save company details**. 

## Delete a company

If you no longer require a company to be available in the Relationship Manager Portal, you can delete it. This action will delete the company record and all the data you previously received from it. As a result, you will no longer be able to access this company's reports in the Portal. This operation is not reversible.

To do that, find the relevant company in the list, click the triple-dot menu and select **Delete company**. 

![An image of the Relationship Manager Portal user interface with five companies listed as examples and the Add company button highlighted](/img/supplier-enablement/0055-se-rm-portal-delete-company.png)

A warning message will appear, requesting you to confirm the deletion. Click **Delete** to proceed. The Relationship Manager Portal will confirm the deletion with a success message.
