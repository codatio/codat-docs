	<Question
		question="Why am I sharing my data? "
		answer={`
Sharing a spend file is one of the essential pieces for driving the success of your card program. This information enables us to accurately analyze your spend, identify cardable opportunities within your supply chain and, ultimately, help you achieve your AP goals, such as improving working capital, preserving float, increasing rebate revenue, or other goals your finance team may have. However, we understand that it can be challenging to share this information. Sharing this information directly from your financial software is a new option that saves you time and removes the hassle of manually submitting financial data to us. The journey to connect your financial software takes just a couple of minutes and is a faster and more secure way of providing this information. It also means that we will have access to the most up-to-date and relevant financial data to provide our service.
