Our updated version of Enhanced Financials reduces the need for highly manual, time-consuming, and repetitive interpretation of SMB account names. 

With Codat, lenders can automate financial statement analysis using our fully standardized profit and loss statement and balance sheet.

Our _Enhanced Profit and Loss Accounts_ and _Enhanced Balance Sheet Accounts_ endpoints return a list of accounts enriched with a suggested category for each account.

If you feel there is a more accurate category that represents an account, you can provide this feedback to us and we will incorporate this into our model training and you will see this improve in the future. 

You can explore this further in [Categorize accounts in the Portal](/assess/portal/categorize-accounts)
