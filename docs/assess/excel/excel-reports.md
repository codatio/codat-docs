The Excel reports endpoints are used to produce and download excel reports. For more information on available reports, see the [report types](#available-report-types) section.

The process to download an Excel report is:

1. [Request](#request-an-excel-report-for-download) an Excel report for download.
2. [Check the progress status](#check-status-of-the-report) of the latest report requested (optional).
3. [Download](#download-the-report) the latest Excel report.

Only one request will be processed at a time per SMB company and per report type. The generated report is kept in blob storage and gets replaced when a new one is generated.

## Check status of the report

The status tells you if the last report requested is complete. It only returns the status of the last report requested, not for older requests. This step is optional and won't affect the generation of the report if it were skipped.

When the report is complete, the `inProgress` field will have the value of _false_ whilst the `success` field will show _true_.
