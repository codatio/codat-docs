### What is a Web Services user?

A Web Services user is a type of user that can only access information in Sage Intacct programmatically, meaning it can't log in, view, and work with Sage Intacct in the same way you can. 

A Sender ID must be paired with a Web Services user to enable Codat's connection to your Sage Intacct instance to work. You have previously created the Sender ID when [adding a Web Services authorization](/smb-help-hub/integrations/sage-intacct/web-services-subscription#how-do-i-add-a-web-services-authorization).

For more information on Web Services users in Sage, see Sage's [Web Services users](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Administration/Users/web-services-only-users.htm).

### How do I set up a Web Services user?

#### Create a Web Services user

1. In Sage Intacct's menu dropdown, navigate to **Company > Admin > Web Services users**, then click **Add**. This will open the _Web Services user information_ page in Sage.

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the dropdown menu that follows the Company to Admin to Web Services users path. The Web Services users menu option is highlighted.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0012-sageintacct-ws-user-menupath.png)

2. Switch between Codat's connection flow and Sage Intacct to copy and paste the autogenerated values from the flow into the **User ID** and **Username** fields on the _Web Services user information_ page. 

    Enter a valid **Account email address**. Ensure you are able to access this email’s inbox. Leave **Status** as _Active_. 

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Web Services user information window. Next to it, an image of the connection flow is added with User ID and Username fields visible. There are arrows showing the process of copying and pasting User ID and Username values from the flow to the Sage Intacct window.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0013-sageintacct-ws-user-copyuser.png)

3. Click on the **Contact name** dropdown, then click **Add**. Paste the **Username** you copied as the **First name**, **Last name**, **Suggested contact name** and **Print as** values in the pop-up window. Click **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the contact name creation pop-up. The First name, Last name, Suggested contact name, and Print as values are filled in and outlined. The Save button is also outlined.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0014-sageintacct-ws-user-contactname.png)

#### Create a role for the Web Services user

1. Continue on the _Web Services user information_ page in Sage.

    In the _Sage Intacct Financials permissions_ section, select _Business_ as the **User type** and _Full_ for **Admin privileges**. 
    
2. Click on the **Role** dropdown, then **Add** to create a new full access role.

    :::tip Already have a full access role?
    If you're using an existing role with full permissions, select it in the **Role** dropdown and move to [complete the Web Services user setup](/smb-help-hub/integrations/sage-intacct/web-services-user#complete-web-services-user-setup). 
    :::

    :::caution Don't see the Role dropdown?
    If you don’t see the **Role** table on the _Web Services user information_ page, it’s likely your Sage Intacct has _user-based permissions_. 
    
    Switch to [assigning permissions to the user](/smb-help-hub/integrations/sage-intacct/web-services-user#how-do-i-set-user-permissions) instead.
    :::
    
    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Sage Intacct financials permissions section. User type is set to Business and outlined, Admin privileges are set to Full and outlined, and the Add option in the Role dropdown is highlighted.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0015-sageintacct-ws-user-addrole.png)

3. Switch between Codat's connection flow and Sage Intacct to copy and paste the autogenerated values from the flow into the **Name** and **Description** fields in the _Roles information_ pop-up window. Click **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Role information screen. Next to it, an image of the connection flow is added with Name and Description fields visible. There are arrows showing the process of copying and pasting Name and Description values from the flow to the Sage Intacct window.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0016-sageintacct-ws-user-createrole.png)

#### Complete Web Services user setup

To finalize the creation of the Web Services user, click **Save** in the user information screen, then click **Create** in the pop-up and verify the action with your Sage Intacct password.

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Web Services user information screen. The final user Save button is highlighted.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0017-sageintacct-ws-user-saveuser.png)

### How do I set role permissions?

:::caution Didn't see roles or create a role?

If you didn’t see the **Role** table on the _Web Services user information_ page and didn't create a new role in the process, switch to [assigning permissions to the user](/smb-help-hub/integrations/sage-intacct/web-services-user#how-do-i-set-user-permissions) instead.
:::

Following the steps outlined above, you've created a new role and assigned it to your Web Services user. Next, you need to assign permissions to this role. 

Permissions enable the Web Services user to perform a particular function. We recommend assigning full permissions to ensure the connection to your Sage Intacct account works as intended.

For more information on user permissions in Sage, see Sage's [About user permissions](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Administration/Permissions/user-permissions-to-intacct.htm?tocpath=Administration%7CPermissions%7C_____4).

1. In Sage Intacct's menu dropdown, navigate to **Company > Admin > Roles**, locate the role you created, and click **View**. 

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Roles list with the View button outlined on the line with the role created in the previous steps.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0018-sageintacct-ws-role-view.png)

2. In the _Roles information_ screen, click **View subscriptions** to open the _Roles subscriptions_ for your role.

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Roles list with the View button outlined on the line with the role created in the previous steps.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0019-sageintacct-ws-subscriptions-view.png)

3. On the _Company_ line, click **Permissions**. In the pop-up window, select the **All** radio button on the right, then click **Save**. Repeat this sequence for each of the following modules and applications:

  ||||
  |------------------|---------------------|------------|
  | Administration  | Accounts Payable    | Order Entry |
  | Company         | Accounts Receivable | Purchasing  |
  | Cash Management | Projects            | Contracts   |
  | General Ledger  | Inventory Control   | Taxes       |

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Modules list in the background, with the Company line outlined. In the foreground, the permissions pop-up for Company is visible. The All radiobutton is selected, and the Save button is outlined.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0020-sageintacct-ws-permissions-all.png)

4. When you set permissions for each required module, click **Save** in the _Roles subscriptions_ screen, then click **Done** to return to the _Roles_ screen. 

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Roles list with the View button outlined on the line with the role created in the previous steps.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0021-sageintacct-ws-permissions-role-save.png)

### How do I set user permissions?

If you don’t see the **Role** table in the _Sage Intacct Financials permissions_ section when creating a new Web Services user, it’s likely because your Sage Intacct instance is configured with user-based permissions. 

To finish setting up your Web Services user and the relevant permissions, follow these steps:

1. Continue on the _Web Services user information_ page in Sage.

    In the _Sage Intacct Financials permissions_ section, select _Business_ as the **User type** and _Full_ for **Admin privileges**. 

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Sage Intacct financials permissions section. User type is set to Business and outlined, Admin privileges are set to Full and outlined.](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0022-sageintacct-ws-user-based.png)

2. Click **Save** in the _Web Services user information_ screen, then click **Create** in the pop-up and verify the action with your Sage Intacct password.

    ![Screenshot of Sage Intacct interface displaying the Sage Intacct financials permissions section. The Save button is outlined](/img/smb-help-hub/sage-intacct/0023-sageintacct-ws-user-based-save.png)

3. The _User application subscriptions_ window will appear for the Web Services user you created. 

    For each of the following modules and applications, click **Permissions**. Select the **All** radio button on the right of the pop-up window, then click **Save**.

### How do I check my role's permissions?

If you are using an existing role to assign it to your new Web Services user, you may want to check it has the full set of required permissions:

1. In Sage Intacct's menu dropdown, navigate to **Company > Admin > Roles**, locate the role you plan to assign, and click **View**.

2. In the _Roles information_ screen, click **View subscriptions** to open the _Roles subscriptions_ for your role.

For full access permissions, ensure that all permissions are selected for each of the following modules and applications.

||||
|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Administration  | Accounts Payable    | Order Entry |
| Company         | Accounts Receivable | Purchasing  |
| Cash Management | Projects            | Contracts   |
| General Ledger  | Inventory Control   | Taxes       |

If you want to check the permissions at a granular level, review the [How do I assign permissions to the role?](/smb-help-hub/integrations/sage-intacct/web-services-user#how-do-i-set-role-permissions) section.
