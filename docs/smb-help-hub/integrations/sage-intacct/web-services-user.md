### What is a Web Services user?

A Web Services user is a type of user that can only access information in Sage Intacct programmatically, meaning it can't log in, view, and work with Sage Intacct in the same way you can. 

A Sender ID must be paired with a Web Services user to enable Codat's connection to your Sage Intacct instance to work. You have previously created the Sender ID when [adding a Web Services authorization](/smb-help-hub/integrations/sage-intacct/web-services-subscription#how-do-i-add-a-web-services-authorization).

For more information on Web Services users in Sage, see Sage's [Web Services users](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Administration/Users/web-services-only-users.htm).

### How do I create a Web Services user?



1. Navigate to Company > Admin > Web Services users in the menu dropdown, then click Add.



2. Copy and paste the values below in the User information tab. 

Switch between Codat's connection flow and Sage Intacct to copy and paste the values from the flow into the pop-up _Web Services sender information_ window. 

    You must use the values provided in the flow, otherwise the connection will fail. 

3. Enter a valid Account email address . Ensure you are able to access this emailâ€™s inbox.



4. Select Business as the User type and Full for Admin privileges. 



5. Click Add in the Contact name dropdown. 



6. Use the Username in the Suggested contact name and Print as fields in the pop-up window. Click Save.



7. Return to this page and click Next.

Business as the User type and Full for Admin privileges. 

Enter the user's Account email address.
This field is used for verification purposes whenever the user initiates or requests a password reset. If a Contact is associated with the user, the Account email address does not have to match the Primary email address of the associated Contact name. Users can update the Account email address from the My preferences page.
You can control the user's ability to log in by changing the Status from active to locked-out or inactive. Learn more about the meaning of each status.
New users can only be created with a status of Active or Locked out. You can edit a user after creation to change its status to Inactive.
Select a User type for the user. User type controls the maximum features available to the user, while permissions set what a user can actually within those restrictions. Learn more about what each user type can do.
For a Business user type, determine whether the user has Admin privileges. If you do not want the user to be an administrator, select Off. Otherwise, select either Limited or Full.
A user with administrator privileges is given the highest possible level of system access, including the ability to:
Configure and subscribe to applications
Create users
Assign permissions to users
A full administrator has complete administration privileges, including the ability to create other full administrators, access to all features in Platform Services, which let admins edit pages in Intacct.
Additionally, in role-based companies, full administrators can use the Try role feature. Limited administrators have all administration privileges, except for the aforementioned items.





### How do I create a role for the Web Services user?

to create a full access role, 

we recommend creating a new role so that we an make sure it has the correct access settings. If you already have a full access role you can assign to this user, you can skip this step and proceed to Y. 

steps from the figma

you may encounter the following scenarios: 

- no roles information tab

- you already have a role

### How do I assign permissions to this role?

#### Assign full permissions

Permissions enable users to perform a particular function or task within a specific area of the product. For example, you might grant permission within the General Ledger to view financial reports but not to create, edit, or delete them.
By assigning permissions to a role, you automatically grant the permissions to all users who have that role.
To update permissions, you must be a full administrator or be a limited administrator with privileges to "assign permissions."
