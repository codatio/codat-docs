## Web Services subscription 

### What is a Web Services subscription?

A Web Services subscription is a mechanism that enables you to share information from Sage Intacct with external software. Codat needs this subscription enabled so that we can quickly and easily read business data from your account and show it to your financial services provider. 

For more information on the Web Services subscription in Sage, see [Subscribe to Web Services](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/More/Customization_and_Platform_Services/Setup/subscribe-to-web-services.htm).

Use the Web Services authorizations list to control which sender IDs can and cannot make Web Services requests to your company. If a sender ID is not on this list, any Web Services requests they make to your company will fail. For this reason, it is important to review your regular Web Services activity and integrations to ensure the proper sender IDs are on your authorization list.

the sender ID we provide these values to you in our flow. You MUST use these values in the  authorization, otherwise the connection estup will not be successful.
