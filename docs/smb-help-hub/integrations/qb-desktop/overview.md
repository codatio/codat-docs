Your financial services provider has requested access to your QuickBooks Desktop account and its data. They need to view, create or modify your business's financial data so that they can deliver their services to you. They use Codat to establish the connection to your QuickBooks Desktop account and asked you to follow our QuickBooks Desktop connection flow.

## Supported access options

At the start of the connection flow, choose the way you access your QuickBooks Desktop software. We need this information to customize the subsequent steps of the flow. There are 4 options to choose from. 

| # | Option                           | Guidance                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | QuickBooks Desktop app           | Choose this option if your QBD app is installed on your physical machine and can be accessed without Internet. To check, navigate to **Start > Settings > Apps** on your machine and search for QuickBooks Desktop. |
| 2 | QuickBooks Enterprise with Cloud | With this option, you can access your enterprise version of QuickBooks from any machine with an active Internet connection.                                                                                         |
| 3 | Rightworks                       | This option applies if you login to a remote desktop connection first, and then open the QuickBooks Desktop app as a second step.                                                                                   |
| 4 | Another hosting provider         | Choose this option if none of the above apply. The connection may not work as expected because this is an unsupported access option.                                                                                |
