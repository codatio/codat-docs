:::info QuickBooks Enterprise with Cloud or Rightworks 

If you are using QuickBooks Enterprise with Cloud or login with Rightworks, you won't see these steps in the connection flow because they are not required for your access options. 

:::

If you are using a locally installed QuickBooks Desktop application, you will be asked to install the QuickBooks Web Connector. To do so: 

1. Close the QuickBooks Desktop application on your machine. 
2. Click the **Download installer** button in the connection flow. 

    If you're blocked from installing, contact your system administrator.
3. Locate the downloaded file on your machine and run it. Your Windows user must have administrator rights to perform this. 
4. In the _QBWebConnector InstallShield Wizard_ that opens in a separate window, follow the installation instructions. 
5. Once the installation completes, return to the connection flow and proceed to the next step.
