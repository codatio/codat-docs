## Why is my provider using Codat?

Codat clients include financial institutions, payments providers, business lenders, software companies and more. They range from some of the world’s largest banks to the newest and most innovative start-ups.

Our clients can only use Codat to access the data of their customers and only when their customers authorize this sharing. We never share data across different Codat clients.

Small businesses need their financial service and software providers to enable integrations to their other systems, but integrations can be difficult to build and maintain.

Building and maintaining integrations is simpler with Codat. This is because we map all the underlying connections to a common standard. Rather than having to plug lots of differently-shaped plugs into lots of differently-shaped sockets, Codat provides a standard way for small business data to be shared and moved between different systems.
