Our **accounts payable** feature offers a thorough breakdown of a borrower's creditors ledger sourced from their accounting software. You can examine the ledger in its entirety or delve into specific supplier histories, enabling full automation of the payables financing process.

## Use cases

Common uses of our accounts payable feature include:

- **Digital data collection:** get an ongoing feed of supplier invoices.

- **Supplier risk analysis:** gain insights into the borrower's relationship with the supplier including a fully history of bills, payment behaviour, and discounts provided on previous bills.

## Supported outputs

You can retrieve the data read and enriched by the feature by [downloading a report in an Excel format](/lending/features/excel-download-overview) or calling the **accounts payable** [endpoints of our API](/lending-api#/operations/list-accounting-bill-credit-notes).

For example, use the [List suppliers](/lending-api#/operations/list-accounting-suppliers) endpoint to access the company's current suppliers for further assessment.

## Get started

Once you have the Lending solution enabled, configure your instance to work with our accounts payable feature. 

#### Configure data sources

Follow the respective guides to set up and enable accounting integrations that will serve as a data source for the feature:

<IntegrationsList integrations={accountingIntegrations} />

#### Enable data types and sync schedule

See how to [enable data types](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#override-the-default-sync-settings) and ensure the following data types have been switched on:

- Suppliers `suppliers`
- Bills `bills`
- Bill payments `billPayments`
- Bill credit notes `billCreditNotes`

Configure the solution to refresh data when you need it by [setting a synchronization frequency](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#choose-a-synchronization-frequency). We recommend setting it to a daily or monthly sync.

#### Configure webhooks

We recommend you [configure webhook consumers](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer) with the following [event types](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types) to manage your data pipelines. These webhooks send a message for each `dataType` separately.

- [Dataset status has changed to an error state](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types)  

  This means an issue occurred when syncing the specified data type. Resolve the issue and [initiate the sync](/using-the-api/queueing-data-syncs#refresh-data) for this dataset again. 
 
- [Dataset data changed](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types)  

  This means data has been updated for the specified data type. This can include new, updated or deleted data. You should then refresh the data in your platform.
