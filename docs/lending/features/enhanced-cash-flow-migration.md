## Retrieve Transactions Data

#### **Old Endpoint**

`GET /companies/{companyId}/reports/enhancedCashFlow/transactions`

#### New Endpoints

`GET /companies/{companyId}/reports/categorizedBankStatement/latest/accounts`

`GET /companies/{companyId}/reports/categorizedBankStatement/latest/transactions`

Refer to the [List Accounts Endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/list-categorized-bank-statement-accounts) and [List Transactions Endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-categorized-bank-statement-transactions) documentations for details.
:::warning Important Workflow Update

For retrieving transactions data, unlike the old endpoints, the new endpoints require that a report already exists **and its status is** `Complete` before retrieving accounts or transactions.

**Action Required**: Update your workflow to first call:

`POST /companies/{companyId}/reports/categorizedBankStatement`

â€¦and ensure the report status is `Complete` before making requests to the new accounts or transactions endpoints.
:::

:::tip How to Check for Completion

You can verify the report's completion in **two ways**:

1. **Poll the Status Endpoint**

   `GET /companies/{companyId}/reports/categorizedBankStatement/latest/status`

2. **Listen to Webhook Event**  
    Subscribe to the webhook:

   `reports.categorizedBankStatement.generate.successful`

   This webhook fires when the report generation is complete.

   For more details, see [Webhooks Overview](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/overview)
