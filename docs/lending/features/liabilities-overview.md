Our **liabilities** feature simplifies the evaluation of a borrower's financial obligations. Machine learning models automatically identify loans from connected sources and provide lenders with a clear overview of a borrower's outstanding loans and their repayment history.

## Use cases

Common uses of our liabilities feature include:

- **Risk assessment:** helps assess the borrower's risk profile and repayment reliability.

- **Debt capacity:** evaluates if the business can handle more debt without financial strain.

- **Repayment behaviour:** indicates if the borrower makes payments on time or defaults.

- **Loan structuring:** tailors new loan terms to fit the borrower's financial situation.

## Supported outputs

You can retrieve the data pulled by the feature by calling the **liabilities** [endpoints of our API](/lending-api#/operations/generate-loan-transactions). For example, use the [Get loan summaries](/lending-api#/operations/get-loan-summary) endpoint to review a company's loan repayment history and determine their drawdown to repayment ratio.

## Get started

Once you have the Lending API enabled, configure your instance to work with our liabilities feature. 

#### Configure data sources

Follow the respective guides to set up and enable at least one accounting, banking, or commerce integration that will serve as a data source for the feature:

##### Accounting

<IntegrationsList filter={['Dynamics 365 Business Central', 'Exact Online', 'FreshBooks', 'MYOB Business', 'Oracle NetSuite', 'QuickBooks Online', 'QuickBooks Desktop', 'Sage 50', 'Sage Business Cloud Accounting', 'Xero']} />

##### Commerce

<IntegrationsList filter={['Stripe', 'Zettle']} />

#### Enable data types and sync schedule

See how to [enable data types](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#override-the-default-sync-settings) and ensure the following data types have been switched on:

- Proft and loss `profitAndLoss`
- Balance sheet `balanceSheet`
- Chart of accounts `chartOfAccounts`
- Journal entries `journalEntries`
- Accounts `banking-accounts`
- Transactions `banking-transactions`
- Transactions `commerce-transactions`

Configure the solution to refresh data when you need it by [setting a synchronization frequency](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#choose-a-synchronization-frequency). We recommend setting it to a daily or a monthly sync.

#### Configure webhooks

We recommend you [configure webhook consumers](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer) with the following [event types](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types) to manage your data pipelines. These webhooks send a message for each `dataType` separately.

- [`DataSyncStatusChangedToError`](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types)  

  This means an issue occurred when syncing the specified data type. Resolve the issue and [initiate the sync](/using-the-api/queueing-data-syncs#refresh-data) for this dataset again. 
 
- [`DatasetDataChanged`](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types)  

  This means data has been updated for the specified data type. This can include new, updated or deleted data. You should then refresh the data in your platform.
