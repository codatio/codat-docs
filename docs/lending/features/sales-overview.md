## Supported outputs

You can retrieve the data pulled and enriched by the feature by calling the **sales** [endpoints of our API](/lending-api#/).

For example, recurring revenue-based lenders seeking to evaluate month-on-month growth can utilize the [Get commerce revenue metrics](/lending-api#/operations/get-commerce-revenue-metrics) endpoint.

## Get started

Once you have the Lending API enabled, configure your instance to work with our sales feature. 

#### Configure data sources

Follow the respective guides to set up and enable commerce integrations that will serve as a data source for the feature:

<IntegrationsList integrations={commerceIntegrations} />


#### Enable data types and sync schedule

See how to [enable data types](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#override-the-default-sync-settings) and ensure the following data types have been switched on:

- Customers `commerce-customers`
- Disputes `commerce-disputes`
- Locations `commerce-locations`
- Orders `commerce-orders`
- Payment methods `commerce-paymentMethods`
- Payments `commerce-payments`
- Products `commerce-products`
- Product categories `commerce-productCategories`
- Transactions `commerce-transactions`

Configure the solution to refresh data when you need it by [setting a synchronization frequency](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#choose-a-synchronization-frequency). We recommend setting it to a daily or a monthly sync.

#### Configure webhooks

We recommend you [configure webhook consumers](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer) with the following [event types](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types) to manage your data pipelines. These webhooks send a message for each `dataType` separately.

- [`DataSyncStatusChangedToError`](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types)  

  This means an issue has occurred when syncing the specified data type. Resolve the issue and [initiate the sync](/using-the-api/queueing-data-syncs#refresh-data) for this dataset again. 
 
- [`DatasetDataChanged`](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types)  

  This means data has been updated for the specified data type. This can include new, updated, or deleted data. You should then refresh the data in your platform.
