**Categories**

The chart of accounts defines the financial structure of a company by providing a list of all accounts used in the company's general ledger. The Categories feature lets you and your customers categorize transactions into one of the account types, such as Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses. There are 162 account categories defined that businesses can use.

Other features of Assess leverages the Categories feature and are reliant on complete and accurate categorizations to produce meaningful results. See our categories documentation:

- Portal: Categorization of accounts
- API: Categorization of accounts

**Enhanced Financials**

These are fully categorized profit and loss, and balance sheet statements broken down by three levels of categories and the company's Chart of Accounts.

**Accounting Financial Metrics**

This feature provides a set of pre-calculated accounting ratios and metrics used to assess company financial performance.

**Data integrity**

The Data Integrity feature matches bank accounts and transactions reported in an accounting package against bank accounts and transactions reported in banking sources.

**Commerce Metrics**

This feature provides a set of pre-calculated commerce ratios and metrics used to assess company financial performance.

We only produce commerce metrics for platforms that support the following data types:

- Commerce - Company Info
- Commerce - Customers
- Commerce - Orders
