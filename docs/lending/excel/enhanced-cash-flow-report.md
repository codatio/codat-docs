Our Enhanced Cash Flow Excel report gives you the same data you'd get from the [Enhanced Cash Flow](/lending/enhanced-cash-flow/overview) endpoint but in an Excel workbook.  You can use the report to test some companies and familiarize yourself with the data before building to the equivalent API endpoint.

The report contains the output of the [Enhanced Cash Flow](/lending/enhanced-cash-flow/overview) feature.

## Prerequisites

The Enhanced Cash Flow Excel report requires a company to have the following datatypes to be synced:

- Banking-accounts
- Banking-transactions

If these requirements are not met an empty Excel workbook will be returned.

## Generating the report

You can generate the Enhanced Cash Flow Excel report using the API or the Codat Portal. The [Lending reports in Excel](/lending/excel/overview) article describes how to generate and download the report using the API.

## Using the report

The report provides information about the company's banking accounts and banking transactions. The transactions are ordered by date and contain the confidence and financial category metrics.
