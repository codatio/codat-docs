With Enhanced Financials, Codat automatically suggests a category for each account that appears in the enhanced Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet. 

Every account is assigned one of Codatâ€™s 270+ categories.  If you disagree with the suggested category, you can change it to a more suitable one. This only impacts the category field in Lending and does not lead to any changes in the underlying accounting platform.

You can view all available categories proposed for accounts and, where relevant, recategorize them in the <a href="https://app.codat.io/" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>. 

1. Navigate to **Companies**, then click the company that requires categorization review. Select **Products > Lending** in the side menu. Finally, click **Categorize accounts**.

2. Here, you can view the categories for each account.  These are ordered by _importance_, which is determined by the current account balance and our confidence that we have correctly categorised this account.  An account with a high _importance_ can affect the [Enhanced Financials](/lending/enhanced-financials/overview) more than an account with a low importance.

3. To change the category of an account, select the accounts using the checkbox and click **Recategorize**. 

   Choose an appropriate category from the proposed five levels and click **Recategorize**.  This saves the newly assigned category.  Once you have confirmed or edited an account, the _importance_ will change to zero.

That's it! The Enhanced Profit and Loss and Enhanced Balance Sheet will return the updated category for the accounts going forward.
