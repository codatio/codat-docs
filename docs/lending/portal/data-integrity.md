## Data integrity in the Codat Portal

To view the Data Integrity feature in the Portal, a company needs to:

- Be linked to an accounting and banking source of data. You can do this either in the Codat [Portal](https://app.codat.io/) or using the Codat API.
- Have bank accounts and bank transactions set to [sync](/core-concepts/data-type-settings).
- Select **View data > Data integrity** by the linked company to display the cross-referenced results. All matched transactions are listed under the **Records found** tab. Transactions for which no matches were found are listed under **Records not found**.

The red exclamation mark indicates that a matching accounting account could not be found for the banking account. Click the indicator to reveal more information, as shown in the following image. This is not an error &mdash; it's an indication that a bank account exists but was not matched against the accounting platform.
