## Required data types

All data types relevant to the generation of commerce metrics are activated automatically when the Lending product is enabled for your Codat client. In case of issues when generating the metrics, check that the following data types have not been accidentally disabled: 

- Commerce - Company Info
- Commerce - Customers
- Commerce - Orders

## Supported integrations

Some commerce integrations do not provide the data required to calculate commerce metrics. 

Check our [coverage explorer](https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-integration) to verify that the integration you want to produce commerce metrics for supports the required data types (listed previously).
