Commerce metrics includes a set of pre-calculated ratios and metrics focussed on commerce/sales data to assess merchant health. It exposes some of the key insights lenders need to assess the credit risk of a company using commerce data. _Commerce Metrics_ provides the data that lets you see what works and what doesn't, providing the opportunity to advise your customers / prospects on what they can do to improve their performance.

## What metrics are available?

Five endpoints return commerce metrics on:

- Revenue (see [API ref](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-commerce-revenue-metrics))
- Orders (see [API ref](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-commerce-orders-metrics))
- Refunds (see [API ref](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-commerce-refunds-metrics))
- Customer retention (see [API ref](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-commerce-customer-retention-metrics))
- Lifetime value (see [API ref](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-commerce-lifetime-value-metrics))

The following table details which metrics are calculated and their formulas:
