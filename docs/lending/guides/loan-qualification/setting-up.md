### ðŸš€ In this section, you will...

* Create your Codat account
* Enable the Lending product
* Configure webhooks
* Set up your local environment
* Run the demo app

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Create a Codat account 

We provide a [free account](https://signup.codat.io/) that lets you explore and test our APIs and other products, including Lending. It also comes equipped with a sample company. When you start working on your own loan qualification solution, you may want to explore our other [plans](https://www.codat.io/plans/).

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Enable the Lending product 

In the **Settings > Organization settings > [Products](https://app.codat.io/settings/products)** section of the Codat Portal, find **Lending** in the list of products and enable it. This also enables the data types required by this product. For example, `balanceSheet` and `profitandLoss`, which are used by the demo app, will be enabled.

We use Lending's [categorization](https://docs.codat.io/lending/portal/categorize-accounts) feature. It allows you to perform automated decisioning based on the categorized accounts. 

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Update your auth flow settings

In the **Settings > Auth Flow > Link** [settings](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/data-connections), ensure the _Sandbox integrations_ switch is toggled on. Check that the _Accounting_ integration category is enabled, and disable _Commerce_ and _Banking_ integration categories. 

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Listen for webhooks

The app will use several webhooks to track the completion of the financial data sync and the categorization of accounts, and Sandbox linking completion. 

We will use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) here to listen for Codat's webhooks. 

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="win" label="Windows OS">  

   In Windows PowerShell, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   choco install ngrok
   ngrok http 5069
   ```

   This will install ngrok using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and run it at port 5069. 

   Copy the **forwarding address** - this will be the `<server-url>` for the webhooks.

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac OS">

   In the terminal, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   brew install ngrok
   ngrok http 5069
   ```
   This will install ngrok using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run it at port 5069. 

   Copy the **forwarding address** - this will be the `<server-url>` for the webhooks.

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Configure Codat webhooks

In the **Settings > Webhooks > [Rules](https://app.codat.io/settings/webhooks/rules)** section of the Codat Portal, create three rules, one for each webhook we will use:

   |  Rule type                                  | Webhook notification URL                                    |
   |---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Company Data Connection status has changed  | ```<server-url>/webhooks/codat/data-connection-status```       |
   | Data sync completed                         | ```<server-url>/webhooks/codat/datatype-sync-complete```       |
   | Account categories updated                  | ```<server-url>/webhooks/codat/account-categorisation-update```|

Click **Create rule** to open the new rule creation window. Select the rule type, apply it to all companies, and assign it a webhook URL. Make sure to replace the `<server-url>` with your forwarding address.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Clone the code

Clone our demo repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/codatio/demo-loan-qualification) to download the loan qualification demo app. 

The main file directory for the demo app is `Codat.Demos.Underwriting.Api`. Key logic components of the app are located in `Controllers`, `Orchestrator`, and `Services` folders.

Note that the other directory in the repository, `Codat.Demos.Underwriting.Api.Tests`, contains a series of unit tests for the demo app and is not needed for you to run the demo project. 

```sh title="Codat.Demos.Underwriting.Api directory"
   â”œâ”€â”€BindingModule.cs
   â”œâ”€â”€Codat.Demos.Underwriting.Api.csproj
   â”œâ”€â”€Program.cs

      â””â”€â”€LoanUnderwriter.cs  // Decision process method for the underwriting model used in the demo
```
### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Set your API key

In the [Developers](https://app.codat.io/developers/api-keys) section of the Codat Portal, copy your API key from the **API key** column **(not the auth header)**. You can click **Create another API key** if one wasn't automatically generated for you. In the `Codat.Demos.Underwriting.Api\` directory, edit the `appsettings.json` file and enter the API key you just copied as the `CodatApiKey`.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Run the app

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cmd" label="Command line">

Run the following command in the root directory `Codat.Demos.Underwriting.Api`:

```sh
dotnet run --launch-profile http
```
Once running, open the Swagger page in your web browser: `http://localhost:5069/swagger/index.html` You will use it to call the demo's endpoints.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rider" label="Rider">

Make sure the `http` profile is set and press "Run". The IDE will automatically open [Swagger](http://localhost:5069/swagger/index.html) in a new tab of your browser. You will use it to call the demo's endpoints.

<TabItem value="vs" label="Visual studio">

Ensure the `http` profile is set and press the "Play" icon. The IDE will automatically open [Swagger](http://localhost:5069/swagger/index.html) in a new tab of your browser. You will use it to call the demo's endpoints.
