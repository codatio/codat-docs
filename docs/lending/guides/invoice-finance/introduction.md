### Summary

üéØ With our demo app, you will go through the invoice financing process flow, from establishing a connection with a borrower's accounting software to issuing a decision on selected invoices. You will see how Codat makes it easier for the borrower to raise capital against the amounts due from customers, and for the lender to make an invoice financing decision. 

‚è≥ Estimated time to complete: 15-25 minutes

üõ†Ô∏è The demo project is implemented in [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) as a backend API. You can configure and run the demo app in the terminal, or use your preferred IDE or code editor.

### About the demo app

The app's codebase is available via our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/codatio/demo-invoice-finance). Clone it locally to try out the application.

The codebase uses Codat's [Lending](/lending/overview) solution to make an invoice financing decision. We will walk you through the setup in the Portal and the code when [setting up the demo app](/lending/guides/invoice-finance/setting-up).
