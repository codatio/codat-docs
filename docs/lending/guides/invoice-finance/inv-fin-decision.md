### üöÄ In this section, you will...

* Understand how we fetch the required data, 
* Review how we assess the risk associated with customers and invoices,
* See how the app makes a decision based on that data. 

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Fetch unpaid invoices and associated data

After the app is notified by the webhook that invoice and customer syncs are complete, it fetches a filtered invoice list that we could potentially lend against. 

In our demo, we focus on unpaid and partially paid invoices valued between 50 and 1000 USD, using the `query` parameter on our [List invoices](/accounting-api#/operations/list-invoices) endpoint:

```
query = {status=submitted||status=partiallyPaid}&&currency=USD&&{amountDue>50&&amountDue<=1000}
```

From this data set, we pick up a list of unique customer Ids (`customerRef.id`) for the unpaid invoices, and then the associated customer details using the [Get customers](/accounting-api#/operations/get-customers) endpoint. 

Finally, we fetch all paid invoices for each of these customers to assess their previous payment behavior. After this, we are ready to perform the risk assessment.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Assess risk for each customer

To perform the risk assessment of customers, we calculate the measure of **customer concentration**. This is the percentage of the applicant's revenue that comes from a single customer. 

The concentration threshold is set to 5% in the `appSettings.json` file, which you can change later if you want to see the app run through a different scenario.

:::info Customer concentration

Concentration = Customer balance / Total outstanding balance across all customers, or, in Codat's terms, it is the sum of all unpaid invoices `amountDue` for a customer divided by the sum of all unpaid invoices `amountDue`.  

:::

In our demo, we also exclude any customers that fit the criteria below, meaning invoices linked to them will not be eligible for the loan: 

- Concentration is more than the threshold of 5%,
- Customer `country` is not `US`, thus excluding foreign business customers,
- Customer `registrationNo` is null, thus excluding sole traders, and
- Number of paid invoices is less than 2, thus lowering the risk based on past behaviour.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Assess risk for each invoice

For each remaining invoice, we calculate the following: 

- **Terms**, expressed as (`dueDate` ‚Äî `issueDate`),
- **Days left to pay**, expressed as (`dueDate` - today's date),
- **Time left to pay ratio**, expressed as (Days left to pay / Terms).

We then discard any invoices where `Days left to pay` value is less than 14 days. For the remaining invoices, we calculate a **charge rate** based on the Time left to pay ratio.

:::info Charge rate

Charge rate = 5 - (4 * Ratio), where Ratio is the Time left to pay rate between 1% and 5%, rounded to 1 decimal place.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Return a decision array

Finally, we are ready to return a decision array to the applicant. It shows them which invoices we agree to lend against, and under what terms and conditions. The array can be obtained by calling the `GET applications/{applicationId}` endpoint. 

```json title="Example decision response"
  {
    "status": "Complete" // Response displays an application status of "Complete" when the assessment has been finished
    "decisions": [ // An array of decisions per each invoice Id found eligible for the loan
      {
        "invoiceId": "string", // Codat's internal Id associated with fetched invoices
        "invoiceNo": "string", // Identifying number of the invoice in the applicant's accounting system
        "amountDue": decimal,  // Amount to be paid on the invoice issued to customer
        "offerAmount": decimal, // Amount the app offers to lend, calculated as 90% of amountDue
        "rate": decimal, // Rate with which the app offers to lend, based on each invoice's risk
      }
                 ]
  }
```
