Our updated version of Enhanced Financials reduces the need for highly manual, time-consuming, and repetitive interpretation of SMB account names. 

With Codat, lenders can automate financial statement analysis using our fully standardized profit and loss statement and balance sheet.

The [Enhanced Profit and Loss Accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-companies-companyId-reports-enhancedProfitAndLoss-accounts) and [Enhanced Balance Sheet Accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-companies-companyId-reports-enhanced/assess-api#/operations/get-companies-companyId-reports-enhancedBalanceSheet-accounts) endpoints return a list of accounts enriched with the latest version of categorization. 


## Enhanced Profit and Loss Accounts

The Enhanced Profit and Loss Accounts endpoint returns a list of categorized accounts that appear on a company’s Profit and Loss. It also includes a balance per the financial statement date.
