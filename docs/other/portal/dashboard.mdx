## Our configuration checklist

Before you start using our API

<LocalStorageChecklist 
  items={[
    'Enable products for your usecase',
    'Configure the integrations you need',
    'Choose what data you\'re interested in',
    'Invite your team',
    'Upgrade when you\'re ready',

## Navigating the Portal

You can use the navigation bar to access other sections of the Portal where you are able to set up, monitor, and use the Codat products.

Some navigation bar tabs (for example, the [Developers](/other/portal/developers) tab) are only available to specific [user roles](/other/user-management/user-roles).

### Home

#### Getting started

Quick-access some useful resources including our getting started guides for both technical and non-technical users, and learn where to find your API keys (if your user role allows you access).

#### Your products

See which products are enabled for your account. By default, Accounting API, Banking API, and Commerce API are enabled.

Clicking **Manage products** takes you to the Products page, where you can manage the products you have enabled, and enable additional products.

#### Dashboard

See real-time insights into the number of companies and the current statuses of their [data connections](/core-concepts/connections). 

The dashboard displays a chart showing the number of total created companies and the number of active companies for the current billing period (depending on your plan).

Beneath this is a breakdown of the number of connections by status. A company's connections can have the following statuses: `Linked`, `PendingAuth`, `Deauthorized`, `Unlinked`, or `No connections`. A company can have multiple connections.

You can access the list of companies by selecting the **View all companies** button.
