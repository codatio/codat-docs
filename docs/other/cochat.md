## Inherent Variability of Results

It's important to acknowledge that, as an AI-powered tool, Cochat utilizes GPT 3.5, which introduces inherent variability in its responses. While Cochat is trained on the Codat documentation and marketing website, the generated results may vary based on the input phrasing, context, and other factors. This variability arises due to the nature of language models and should be taken into consideration when interpreting Cochat's responses.

To minimize variability and enhance accuracy, Cochat has been extensively trained and fine-tuned using large-scale datasets. However, it's essential to understand that occasional incorrect or unexpected responses may still occur. Codat recommends reviewing the Cochat responses critically and validating them against the official Codat documentation when in doubt.

## Risks and Limitations

While Cochat strives to provide accurate and helpful information, it's crucial to be aware of the potential risks associated with using GPT tools like Cochat:

1. **Misinterpretation of Queries**

  GPT models, including Cochat, may occasionally misinterpret queries or provide responses that are not entirely aligned with the intended meaning. Users should carefully review the responses and consider the context before relying solely on Cochat's suggestions.

2. **Lack of Legal and Compliance Advice**

  Cochat is not designed to provide legal or compliance advice. Although it can offer general guidance related to integration practices, it's essential to consult legal and compliance professionals to ensure adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and data protection requirements.

3. **Unpredictable Responses**
  
  Due to the inherent variability of GPT models, Cochat's responses may occasionally be unpredictable or exhibit biases. Codat continually strives to improve the accuracy and reliability of Cochat, but it's important to exercise critical judgment when using its suggestions and consult additional resources as needed.
