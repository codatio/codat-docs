## Invite a new user

When you first gain access to Codat, you'll be set up with a single Administrator account. The account uses the email address of the main point of contact requested during onboarding. This Administrator user can then add new users with different levels of access.

For an explanation of what each user level means, see [User roles](/user-roles).

To add new users from the Codat Portal:

1. Open the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) and sign in to your Administrator account.
2. In the navigation bar, select **Settings > Users**.
3. Select **Invite user** and fill in the user's name and email address.
4. From the **User Role** list, select the [correct permission](/user-roles) level for the user.
5. To complete the account setup, select **Send invitation**.

An e-mail is sent to the user of the new account for them to verify their account details and set up a password.

## Edit existing account details

At any time, users with Administrator access can update account details of all users, including their name, e-mail address, and access level. Administrators can also enable or disable accounts.

1. Open the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) and sign in to your Administrator account.
2. In the navigation bar, select **Settings > Users**.
3. Find the user details you're interested in and select **Edit** next to them.
4. Change any details that you need to and then select **Save changes**.
