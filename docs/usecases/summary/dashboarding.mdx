### How Codat can help

We can support traditional banks, neobanks, financial and business monitoring tools, and climate SaaS companies in their activity by leveraging our [Accounting API](/accounting-api/overview) product. 

For example, you can use Codat when building a financial planning and analysis (FP&A) dashboard, which in turn helps your customers accurately plan, forecast, and budget, make business critical decisions, and support their future financial health.

#### Accounting API

We have done the heavy lifting for you by building integrations with a standardized data model to the accounting software your customers already use. This gives you access to real-time data that you can read, create, or update to support your use case.

In case of an FP&A dashboard, Codat supports the following activities:

- Connecting the accounting software  

Codat handles the authorization, linking, and intricate details such as rate limits of your customers' accounting software.

- Data standardization

Once authorized, utilize Codat's standardization of the data to enable one data model to be used to leverage all accounting software.

- Read financial data

You can use a multitude of our datasets to create or read an accounts payable ledger, an accounts recevable ledger, and journal entries, balance sheet and cashflow statements. 

For an accounts payable ledger, utilize the bills, credit notes, bill payments and suppliers datasets. To build and accounts payable ledger, utilize the invoices, credit notes, payments and customers datasets.
