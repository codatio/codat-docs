## How Codat can help

Sync for Commerce is a white-label application for point-of-sale and eCommerce providers that automates merchant bookkeeping to Codatâ€™s suite of accounting platforms. We map your customers' data according to accounting best practices and features available within each platform. This lets your customer seamlessly reconcile their e-commerce and accounting data, allowing them to spend more time on growing their business. 

They can also understand their cash flow better thanks to the daily import of sales, and automatically reconcile payments, invoices, fees, and payouts on a daily basis to their chart of accounts - as an aggregate invoice or a journal entry.
