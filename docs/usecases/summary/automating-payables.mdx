By integrating your customers' accounting software, their supplier information, invoices, and payments can be easily kept in sync. 

This automation replaces manual tasks and eliminates duplication of effort, freeing up your customers' time so they can concentrate on running their business.

### How Codat can help

Codat supports B2B payment and invoicing companies, payment providers, and vertical SaaS businesses with their integration requirements by leveraging the [Accounting API](/accounting-api/overview) product. 

It enables small and medium sized businesses to track and manage their spend with their chosen application and ensure that their financial reports are kept up to date.
