During lending, the lender evaluates a borrower's financial history, income, assets, and debts to determine the financial risk the borrower poses to the lender. The goal, in the end, is to provide loans and insurance products for SMBs based on the outcome of that assessment.

## How Codat can help

We can support traditional banks, neobanks, and digital lenders in their lending activity by leveraging our [Lending API](/lending/overview) product.

As well as making it easier to access data from a wide range of sources for business lending, the [Lending API](/lending/overview) includes features to help lenders verify the accuracy of data and categorize it in the most useful way to make credit decisions.

We have done the heavy lifting for you by building integrations with a standardized data model to the accounting, commerce, and banking platforms your customers already use. This gives you access to real-time data that you can pull, create, or update to support your use case.

For example, if you need a customer's invoices as part of your assessment, our integrations allow you to pull and monitor invoices and the associated customers. This can even include line-item breakdowns and a PDF copy of the invoice where available. This approach removes the manual effort required to upload and extract the data, saving you time and effort, and providing your customer with a better digital experience. 

You can do this for any data types we support, and even automatically synchronize them on a schedule.

You can also use this data to produce additional insights (e.g. calculate financial ratios) and automate decisioning based on these insights, all via one API.

Codat can support an automatic reconciliation process, helping your customer to reduce the time and effort of manual processing, and increasing accuracy. For example, you can push a payment to their accounting platform and reconcile it against the invoice, marking it as paid.
