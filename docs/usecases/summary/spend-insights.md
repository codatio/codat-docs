Make expense management easier for your small business customers with Codat. We integrate data from corporate cards and expenses management platforms into accounting software your customers use.

## How Codat can help

We can support corporate card providers, neobanks, and expense management platforms in their expense management activity by leveraging our [Bank Feeds](/bank-feeds/overview) and [Expenses](/expenses/overview) products. This will provide your customer with greater visibility of spend tracking against expense categories, and automatically reconcile expense payments against bank statement lines.
