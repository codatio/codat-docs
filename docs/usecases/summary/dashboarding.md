We enable you to pull real-time SMB data from accounting platforms and display it in business management and financial forecasting platforms. This helps you deliver high-level plans and provide better advice to your customers.

### How Codat can help

We can support traditional banks, neobanks, financial and business monitoring tools, and climate SaaS companies in their activity by leveraging our [Accounting API](/accounting-api/overview) product. 

For example, you can use Codat when building a financial planning and analysis (FP&A) dashboard, which in turn helps your customers accurately plan, forecast, and budget, make business critical decisions, and support their future financial health.

**Accounting API**

We have done the heavy lifting for you by building integrations with a standardized data model to the accounting platforms your customers already use. This gives you access to real-time data that you can pull, create, or update to support your use case.

In case of an FP&A dashboard, Codat supports the following activities:

- Connecting the accounting platform  

Codat handles the authorisation, linking, and intricate details such as rate limits to your customers' accounting platforms.

- Data standardisation

Once authorised, utilise Codat's standardisation of the data to enable one data model to be used to leverage all accounting platforms.

- Pull financial data

You can use a multitude of our datasets to create or pull an accounts payable ledger, an accounts recevable ledger, and journal entries, balance sheet and cashflow statements. 

For an accounts payable ledger, utilise the bills, credit notes, bill payments and suppliers datasets. To build and accounts payable ledger, utilise the invoices, credit notes, payments and customers datasets.
