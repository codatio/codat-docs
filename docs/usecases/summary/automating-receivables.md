**Accounting API**

We have done the heavy lifting for you by building integrations with a standardized data model to the accounting platforms your customers already use. This gives you access to real-time data that you can pull, create, or update to support your use case.

Each business may need to reconcile payroll costs, pensions, and taxes to different nominal accounts, based on their business type and the accounting platform they use. Codat provides an endpoint to pull chart of accounts and tracking categories data in order to avoid manual categorization efforts and give flexibility to SMBs for reconciling data. As a payroll platform, you will need to build a flexible interface for your customer to perform the mapping.  

Then, use our create / update functionality to post a journal that shows correct amounts against each account. These transactions can easily be reconciled against the business's bank feed.
