# Overview

Bill pay integration make's it easier for SMBs to manage and pay their supplier invoices from a single interface with preferential payment methods and terms.

Many SMBs still rely on manual AP functions to run their business. One study shows that as many as 80% of all SMB invoices and 40% of all B2B payments are still settled via paper check. That’s led to a situation where a vast majority (80%) of finance leaders believe their company’s outdated AP process is holding them back and costing their business time and money
