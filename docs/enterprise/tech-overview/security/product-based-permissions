# Managing product-based permissions in the Codat Portal

Product-based permissions give clients more control over which companies users can access, based on the products assigned to them.  

These permissions work alongside existing roles. Only administrators can assign product-based permissions.  

---

## How permissions work

### Administrator and Developer roles
- Full access to all products  
- Cannot edit their own product assignment, as they already have unrestricted access  

### Analyst and Onboarding roles
- Can’t access **Settings > Users**  
- Can’t change user roles  
- Can’t change product assignments  
- Must be assigned a product before they can create or view companies  
- From a user perspective: until a product is assigned, no companies are visible and new companies can’t be created  

Once a product has been assigned, these users can create companies.

| **Developer**     | Full access       | ✘                   | ✘                   | ✔                                | ✔                                |
| **Analyst**       | Product required  | ✘                   | ✘                   | ✘                                | Only after product assigned      |
| **Onboarding**    | Product required  | ✘                   | ✘                   | ✘                                | Only after product assigned      |

## Using SSO

- If you’re using Enterprise SSO, ensure the correct Active Directory group is assigned to each user (**Administrator**, **Developer**, **Analyst**, or **Onboarding**).  
- New users set up as **Analysts** or **Onboarders** must log in to the Portal via SSO before a product can be assigned.  

---

## Notes

- Changes to a company’s product assignments update automatically when users refresh the Portal.  
- If an Administrator adds a product to a company that a user doesn’t have access to, the user can still see that the product has been assigned but won’t have access to it.  
- When a company has multiple products assigned, users see all products they have permission to access.
