#### Security & Data Privacy

In our agreement with you, Codat acts as the Processor of your customers' data while you will remain its controller. This relationship allows you to maintain full control over your customers' data, including deciding when to delete that data. 

You should provide the customer with an overview of your Security & Data Privacy policies within your strategic consent journey.

#### Manage Connections UI

The customer should have the ability to add, change, or delete existing connections via a UI. Codat’s API can be used to add additional integrations or delete existing integrations.

When deleting a connection, it is critical that customers are aware of potential impact of rescinding that access. For example, if they are using multiple products you provide, all will be impacted.

#### “Will you have access to all my data?”

The client journey will include direct contact with an RM who will typically be on a call to the client when they share the link.  Once the client receives it, they can log in through the accountancy platform integration provided by Codat.  

Their data is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) in transit and Advanced Encryption Standard - 256 bit (AES-256) at rest. These robust protocols are a requirement of GDPR and are industry standard for processes such as Open Banking. 

This question should be added into a wider set of FAQs that are surfaced within the Strategic Consent Journey.

#### “Will my data be shared securely?”

A customer is likely to be unsure about the underlying technology that allows data to be extracted and surfaced into each relevant application via APIs. 

It is important to provide some comfort to each customer connecting banking and/or accounting software that their data will be shared very securely via 0Auth2.0.

This question should be added into a wider set of FAQs that are surfaced within the Strategic Consent Journey.

#### “What if my accounting software isn’t listed?”

A customer might use an accounting software that isn’t covered by Codat’s set of integrations. If this is the case, it is important to provide guidance for the customer. 

The alternative process will differ for each product, but might involve uploading or sharing data manually.

This question should be added into a wider set of FAQs that are surfaced within the Strategic Consent Journey.

#### “Will you share my data with any third parties?”

A customer might be concerned that their data will be used for reasons other than the specific product or journey they are connecting via.

It is important to provide the customer with reassurance that their data is only being used for the specific purpose within each user journey.

This question should be added into a wider set of FAQs that are surfaced within the Strategic Consent Journey.

#### “How do I revoke access”?

A customer will want to know how to revoke access, is be possible via the Strategic Consent Journey UI - as well as the underlying accounting software.

This question should be added into a wider set of FAQs that are surfaced within the Strategic Consent Journey.
