This is an example flow for a consent journey which powers a business insights dashboard.

* A user is prompted to select their accounting package.
* They view the data they are sharing both in your platform and the accounting package.
* Throughout the journey they are reminded of why they are sharing data and the product's value.
* The journey includes links enabling the user to get help should an issue arise.
* Once linked they are able to manage their connection and disconnect if they wish.
* They are able to reauthorize from the same place if they change their mind.

The example screens are for a business insights dashboard but these points are applicable to any use case.
