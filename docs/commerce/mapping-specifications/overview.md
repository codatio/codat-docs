This section provides guidelines for data mapping configuration from a commerce platform to the supported accounting platforms (Xero, QuickBooks online).

Here you can find out which account types should be selected for every feature and how the data displays in the accounting platform after a successful synchronization via Sync for Commerce.

For demonstration purposes, it references the structure and the UI of the Codat no-code Sync flow solution.

However, Sync for Commerce is a flexible product that allows you to build a similar user experience or design your own to cater to your unique needs.

In Codat's Sync configuration flow, the data types are grouped under the three main features:

- Sales,
- Fees, and
- Payments.
