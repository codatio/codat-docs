Customers may have some common questions about why they should link their accounts, the below is not an exhaustive list, but making these FAQ's available during your link process may increase the success rate of sharing information through their applications.

Attached to this article are the questions and answers in a html format which can be added to your link landing page. You can download these through this link.


## Why link my accounting software? What are the benefits to my business?

By linking your financial platform, we can provide an enhanced service, without you having to send your financials manually.

### Benefits include:

Faster Decisions... Remove the hassle of manually submitting financial data and get access to credit or other services quicker and easier.
Improved Security... Data extracted manually and shared via email or physically by post is at higher risk of theft or loss. Data shared directly via the financial platform is protected by robust security protocols that meet standard data privacy and protection policies.
Enhanced Reliability...
Sharing data directly from your financial platforms reduces the risk of human error and incomplete submissions, giving more confidence in the financial data provided.

## What information are you retrieving?

We are only extracting the same information that you would typically share with us manually. As part of the process, we will show you the information that we are requesting from you. Unless access is required on an ongoing basis and consent is provided, the link will be closed immediately after retrieving the information.

## Why not just email you the documents?

This is faster and more secure than email. You only need to select your accounting package from a list and authorise the connection - the rest is automated. You don’t need to generate any reports or create attachments.

## How secure is my data?

Data security is front of mind at all times. The solution is built using technologies tried and tested in the finance industry and utilizes best practices from the likes of Microsoft. Your data is stored in a Microsoft Azure database as standard. Data is encrypted in transit using SSL and at rest using AES-256 managed by Microsoft Azure. Codat, the technology solution provider, conducts regular penetration tests in line with their ISO27001 certification.

## Why am I being asked for my password?

In order to share your data, your financial software requires you to authorize the connection. This is done directly with your software provider - we do not see your username or password, and we are not able to log in to your financial software.

## How do I know if I connected successfully?

There is a progress bar to show you which step of the process you are currently in (four steps in total). Once you have authorized the connection, you will receive a confirmation screen that lets you know the connection has been successful and that you can close the window.

## Will this expedite the approval process?

Yes. While credit decisioning and underwriting also rely on other data sources, the quicker we can view and analyse your financial data, the quicker we can come to a decision.

## Do I need special software?

No, everything is done over the internet. You are only required to select your financial package from the list and authorize the connection. In the case of accounting software that was installed, such as QuickBooks Desktop, a desktop connector is installed as part of the authorization process and you will need to be on the same computer that the accounting software is installed on.

## I can’t see my accounting platform

Unfortunately, you won’t be able to digitally link your financial data at this time, but please provide details of the accounting system you are using so that we can add it to the list of systems we hope to support in the future.

## Can I disconnect?

You can disconnect the connection at any time from within your accounting platform (typically from the app management settings) or for desktop platforms can uninstall the connector if not automatic during onboarding. If you need further assistance disconnecting, please reach out and we can provide you with instructions specific to your accounting platform.
