Client onboarding

When managing Codat as a partner there are a few operational decisions to consider:

Who will own the configuration
Each instance requires one-off configuration before it is ready for onboarding
For cloud platforms: configuration includes the setup of a developer application within the accounting platform and in some cases approval or contracts before accessing production accounting data
This can be handled by the client or by the partner on-behalf of their clients.
Who will manage and maintain the instance
Who will need on-going access to the Portal including API key(s)
The responsible party should be aware of our Support process and online documentation.
Action required

When onboarding new clients your decision on who owns the configuration and management will impact who should be initially setup on the environment:

Client owned Please provide the clients technical lead as the Admin email
Distributor owned Please provide your own technical leads as the Admin email
Client creation

Codat has two environment:

Staging: Hosts all UAT, Testing and Dev instances
Production: Hosts all Production instances

When onboarding a new client you will need to request the creation of new instance(s) depending on their requirements.

Email solutions@codat.io with:
Company Name
Instances: UAT and/or Production
Admin Email(s): Email address for the technical lead(s) who will own configuration of the instance(s)
Creation and handover
Our Solutions team will setup and checkout your new environment(s) before handover
Email confirmation
Once the instance is ready your Admin(s) will receive a confirmation email and invitation to set their password
If a multi instance user the instance(s) will be added to their view (note staging and production environments remain separate)
