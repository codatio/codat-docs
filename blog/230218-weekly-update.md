## What's new

### New docs

We've just released our new docs!

They are in beta, so you may find some snags in our content.

You can raise issues and [contribute in GitHub](https://github.com/codatio/codat-docs).

These docs feature an improved organization of content and a more detailed, interactive API reference, driven by our improved OpenAPI Specification.

We'd love to hear your opinions, so please let us know how you're finding them in the [discussion here](https://github.com/codatio/codat-docs/discussions/131)!

### Accounting API

## In case you missed it...

### [Sync for Expenses](https://codat2.stoplight.io/docs/sync-for-expenses-v2/fjx7t6em0l1ux-overview)

Launch new accounting integrations faster and save on ongoing maintenance by standardizing how you sync with bookkeeping software and ERPs.

Sync for Expenses is an API and a set of supporting tools. It has been built to enable corporate card and expense management platforms to provide high-quality integrations with multiple accounting software through a standardized API.
