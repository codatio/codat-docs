## What's new?

Our [Lending](/lending/overview) solution now supports generating [Categorized Financial Statements](/lending/features/financial-statements-overview) for Sage Intacct.  
This means you can **connect, retrieve, and analyze detailed financial statements** from customers who use Sage Intacct, helping you make better credit and risk decisions.

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant to **all clients using or planning to use** Codat’s [Lending](/lending/overview) solution — especially those leveraging [Categorized Financial Statements](/lending/features/financial-statements-overview) as part of their credit assessment workflows.

## How to get started?
