We've expanded our [Expenses](/expenses/overview) platform coverage to include support for FreeAgent.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We have expanded the platform coverage of our [Expenses](/expenses/overview) solution to include FreeAgent. This enables you to automate the creation of an expense in your customers' FreeAgent account whenever they incur spend on their corporate card and the creation of a reimbursable expense (bill) for employee expense claims.

## Who is this relevant for?

All clients using or planning to use Codat's [Expenses](/expenses/overview) solution.

## How to get started?

Want to enable FreeAgent support for your application? [Set up the FreeAgent integration](/integrations/accounting/freeagent/accounting-freeagent-setup) using our docs and review our [Expenses API](/sync-for-expenses-api) documentation.
