We’ve updated the QuickBooks Desktop Link flow to provide clearer guidance on how the **Intuit Web Connector** works and to reduce disruption to your customers' day‑to‑day operations.

## What's new?

![Screenshot showing the Connection Management SDK landing page before and after the change, with the old title 'Manage connections' replaced by the new title 'Manage connected accounts'.](/img/updates/2025-10-06-quickbooks-desktop-improved-scheduling-and-reduced-disruption.png)

By default, data now syncs **7pm–7am, Monday to Friday and weekends**. This schedule is designed to **allow users to continue using QuickBooks Desktop while the Intuit Web Connector is running**.

Users can also:
- **Set custom sync schedules** to suit their workflow.
- **Pause syncing for 24 hours** when they need to temporarily minimize activity.

> **Note:** There is no impact for customers who have already connected their QuickBooks Desktop company, their current sync schedule will remain unchanged. However, they’ll be able to configure their own sync schedules starting **January 10, 2026**.

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant for clients whose customers use our QuickBooks Desktop Link flow, especially those who need to minimize disruption during office hours when QuickBooks is in active use.

## How to get started?

This update will **automatically be enabled on January 10, 2026**, but you can turn it on earlier by going to [**Developers > API deprecations**](https://app.codat.io/developers/api-deprecations) in the Portal and enabling **"Improved QuickBooks Desktop Link flow"**.  

If your customers want to adjust their sync settings or pause syncing, they can do so directly within Link.
