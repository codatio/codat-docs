We have changed the way you view data types for our Accounting API, Banking API, and Commerce API data display.

<!--truncate-->

Data types are now accessed via a dropdown menu on the Company data pages instead of a list.

Note that the Accounting API data types are organized into a nested dropdown list as follows:

- Financial statements
  + Balance sheet
  + Operating cash flow
  + Profit & loss
- Earning
  + Customers
  + Invoices
  + Payments
  + Credit notes
  + Aged debtors
  + Direct incomes
- Spending
  + Suppliers
  + Purchase orders
  + Bills
  + Bill payments
  + Bill credit notes
  + Aged creditors
  + Direct costs
- Accounting data
  + Accounts
  + Journal entries
  + Tax rates
  + Tracking categories
  + Account transactions
  + Transfers
- Banking data
  + Bank accounts
  + Bank transactions
  + Reference data
  + Company
  + Items

### Action required
Use the new data type dropdown menus to view company data for our Accounting API, Banking API, and Commerce API.
