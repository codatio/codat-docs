We have changed the way you view data types for our Accounting API, Banking API, and Commerce API data display.

<!--truncate-->

Data types are now accessed via a dropdown menu on the Company data pages instead of a list.

Note that the Accounting API data types are organized into a nested dropdown list as follows:

- Financial statements
  - Balance sheet
  - Operating cash flow
  - Profit & loss
- Earning
  - Customers
  - Invoices
  - Payments
  - Credit notes
  - Aged debtors
  - Direct incomes
- Spending
  - Suppliers
  - Purchase orders
  - Bills
  - Bill payments
  - Bill credit notes
  - Aged creditors
  - Direct costs
- Accounting data
  - Accounts
  - Journal entries
  - Tax rates
  - Tracking categories
  - Account transactions
  - Transfers
- Banking data
  - Bank accounts
  - Bank transactions
  - Reference data
  - Company
  - Items

### Action required

Use the new data type dropdown menus to view company data for our Accounting API, Banking API, and Commerce API.
