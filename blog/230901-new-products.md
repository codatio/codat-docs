We've changed the way we organize our APIs to make Codat easier than ever to use.

<!--truncate-->

The standardized Codat Accounting, Banking, and Commerce APIs you might be familiar with have a large array of functionality, but it can be difficult to know how to use them to achieve what you're trying to achieve.

**We've repackaged all the functionality you're using today into a new, clearer set of products aligned to your use case.**

## What's changed?

- Our [Lending API](/lending/overview) brings together the standardized API functionality that allows you to fetch the underlying financial data and enhances it with the existing powerful Assess features.
- If you're [automating payables](/usecases/summary/accounting-automation) (for example, paying supplier bills), then our new [Sync for Payables](/payables/overview) product has all the Accounting API features you need.
- If you're [managing payroll](/usecases/summary/accounting-automation) (for example, reconciling payroll within a user's accounting software), we've grouped all the functionality you need in our [Sync for Payroll](/payroll/overview) product.

Our existing Sync for Commerce, Sync for Expenses, and Bank Feeds API products remain unchanged.

Each of these new products comes equipped with [SDK libraries](/get-started/libraries) to get you up and running ASAP, including our brand new [C# libraries](https://github.com/codatio/client-sdk-csharp).

## What does this mean for you?

If you've already built to Codat... **Nothing.**

Although things look a little different round here, none of our endpoints or features have changed. You are able to continue using our standardized Accounting, Banking, and Commerce APIs, and their API references and SDKs are still accessible.

If you're just starting your journey with Codat, then you can immediately start making the most of our repackaged products.
