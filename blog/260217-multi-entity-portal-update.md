We are making it easier to identify and navigate multi-entity companies in the Codat Portal.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

On **February 25, 2026**, we are changing how multi-entity companies are displayed in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io). The new hierarchical company table structure makes it easier to identify, navigate, and manage complex entities. 

We are introducing the following improvements:

- Parent–child hierarchy view enables users to quickly identify the parent company and expand the view to see its subsidiaries. 
- Enhanced search functionality allows users to search by the parent or child company name. 
- New triple-dot menu contains company management options, such as editing and deletion.
- Parent deletion confirmation ensures it's no longer possible to accidentally delete a parent company.
- New set of connection statuses helps determine a company's state at a glance:
    
    - **No connections:** The company hasn't yet attempted to connect their financial software.
    - **Linked:** The company has successfully connected their financial software.
    - **Pending:** The company has started, but not completed connecting their financial software.
    - **Deauthorized:** Access to this company was deauthorized and needs to be reconnected.
    - **Unlinked:** The company has unlinked and stopped data sharing.
    - **Partial:** The parent company has subsidiaries that are disconnected.

These improvements apply to all Portal views that use the company structure, such as **Companies** and **Spend Insights**.
