We’re excited to announce that our Zapier integration now supports subscriptions to the latest webhook event types, making it easier than ever to automate your workflows.

## What's new?

- **Subscribe to the latest event types** - stay updated with the newest triggers available.
- **Multiple subscriptions** - subscribe to one or more event types at the same time.
- **New webhook schema** - take advantage of our updated webhook schema for seamless integration.

## Who is this relevant for?

This is relevant for anyone looking to simplify and automate their workflows using Zapier's no-code platform. 

Zapier enables you to connect different web applications and automate repetitive tasks by setting up "rules" that define how data flows between tools and services.
With Codat now part of Zapier, you can easily build workflows tailored to your needs without writing any code.

### Why should you care?

With the Codat Zapier app, all [Codat webhooks](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types) are available as *triggers*.
This makes it possible to automate processes and streamline operations, no matter your technical expertise.

### Example use cases

Here’s how you can use Zapier with Codat:
- **Real-time notifications** - send a Slack message or email whenever a new company shares data with you.
- **Error tracking** - post an alert when a sync error occurs to ensure quick resolution.
- **Data management** - automatically add onboarded companies to a spreadsheet.

If you’re looking to save time and enhance efficiency, this integration is perfect for you!

## How to get started?

To start building your own workflows today, you need:

- **A Zapier account** - you can [create one for free](https://zapier.com/sign-up).
