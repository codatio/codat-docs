We’re excited to announce that we've upgraded our Zapier integration to support subscriptions to our latest [webhook event types](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types), making it easier than ever to automate your workflows.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We've published a new version of our Zapier app. With version 2.0, you can: 

- **Subscribe to our latest event types** using the newest available triggers.
- **Create multiple subscriptions** to listen to one or more event types at the same time.
- **Use the updated webhook schema** for seamless integration.

## Who is this relevant for?

This is relevant for anyone looking to automate their workflows using Zapier's no-code platform and clients who are using version 1.0 of our Zapier app. 

Zapier enables you to connect applications and automate tasks by setting up rules that define how data flows between tools and services. With the Codat Zapier app, all [Codat webhooks](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types) are available as *triggers*. This makes it possible to build workflows you need without writing any code. 

For example, here’s how you can use Zapier with Codat:
- **Real-time notifications:** send a Slack message or an email when a new company shares data with you.
- **Error tracking:** post an alert when a sync error occurs to ensure quick resolution.
- **Data management:** automatically add onboarded companies to a spreadsheet.

## How to get started?

To start building your own workflows, you need **a Zapier account** and **Admin or Developer** access to your Codat instance. See how to [create a Zapier workflow](/using-the-api/webhooks/zapier-integration#create-your-workflow) using the Codat app. 

If you already have a Zapier automation built with our version 1.0 app, see how you can [update your existing Zaps](/updates/250109-deprecation-zapier-integration-v1#action-required) to use version 2.0.
