We have expanded our accounting integration coverage to include **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations (F&O)**.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

You can now use Codat's API to connect to and exchange data with **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations** (F&O).

As a powerful ERP designed for medium-to-large enterprises, this integration enables you to:

- **Connect securely** using the standard Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
- **Access comprehensive financial data**, including customers, vendors, invoices, payments, and general ledger entries.
- **Support complex company structures**, with the ability to link and manage data across multiple legal entities.

This addition ensures you can serve larger, mid-market customers who rely on D365 F&O for their financial management.

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant for all clients focused on **mid-market and enterprise businesses**.

## Limited availability

Please note that this integration is currently in a **limited release phase**.

To gain access, you must contact your **Account Manager** or **Customer Success Manager**. They will help you enable the integration for your instance and provide guidance on the specific configuration steps required for your use case.

## How to get started?

Once your AM/CSM has enabled the integration, you will need to register an application in Microsoft Azure to obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You can then finalize the setup in the Codat Portal under **Settings > Integrations**.

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to our Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations setup guide.
