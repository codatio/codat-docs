We have recently released our [new QuickBooks Desktop integration](https://docs.codat.io/updates/240227-qbd-connector). As a result, we will be deprecating the existing legacy integration on **January 10, 2025**.

<!--truncate-->

The new connector simplifies your customer’s linking journey and provides more resilient data acquisition. You can read more about these changes in our [QuickBooks Desktop (on-premise) documentation](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/accounting-quickbooksdesktop).

## Action required

Clients using our legacy QBD integration need to move their existing QBD connections to the new integration by **January 10, 2025**, in order to continue syncing data with QBD.

The migration involves:
 - Testing performed with Codat’s support alongside the existing integration.
 - Reauthorizing your customers who have existing QBD integration.

Your customers' existing connections will retain their historical data. Once your customer reauthorizes the connection via the new connector, you will be able to sync data with this connection as normal.

To get started, contact your Codat account manager.

## Expected impact

After **January 10, 2025**, your existing QBD connections will cease to be supported and all new connections you create and existing connections you re-link will be via the new QBD connector.
