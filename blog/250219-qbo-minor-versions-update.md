On **August 1, 2025**, Intuit will migrate all apps using minor versions 1 through 74 of the QuickBooks Online Accounting API to **minor version 75**. Based on our initial assessment, this change is unlikely to impact you, but we are conducting a full review to confirm.

According to Intuit's [January 21, 2025 change notice](https://blogs.intuit.com/2025/01/21/changes-to-our-accounting-api-that-may-impact-your-application/), this migration will happen automatically.

We are actively analyzing the potential impact and will provide a detailed update by the next deprecation notice on **April 5, 2025**. This update will confirm whether any action is required on your end or outline necessary steps if changes are needed.
