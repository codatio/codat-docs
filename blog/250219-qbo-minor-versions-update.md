On **August 1, 2025**, Intuit will migrate all apps using minor versions to **minor version 75**. This change should not impact your use of Codat.

<!--truncate-->

As Intuit's [January 21, 2025 change notice](https://blogs.intuit.com/2025/01/21/changes-to-our-accounting-api-that-may-impact-your-application/) indicates, the migration from minor versions 1 through 74 of the QuickBooks Online Accounting API to **minor version 75** should happen automatically.

**This change should not impact your use of Codat.** We are continuing to actively analyze the potential impact and will provide a detailed update by the next deprecation cycle on **April 5, 2025** if it emerges that any action needs to be taken, which would outline necessary steps if changes are needed.

## Action required

None.
