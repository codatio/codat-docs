Our Hosted Link flow UI has been updated with a cleaner layout and now allows users to connect their integrations in any order.

## What's new?

We have updated the user interface (UI) of our Hosted Link experience to match the experience provided by the Link SDK. The Hosted Link flow now boasts a cleaner, adaptive layout and allows users to connect their integrations in any order.

You can also choose to enable [one-time Link URLs](/updates/250110-secure-linking) with the new Hosted Link UI.
