Our Hosted Link flow UI has been updated with a cleaner layout and now allows users to connect their integrations in any order.

:::note Updated March 27, 2025

This page has been updated to reflect the change to the default state of one-time Link URLs.

:::

## What's new?

We have updated the user interface (UI) of our Hosted Link experience to match the experience provided by the Link SDK. The Hosted Link flow now boasts a cleaner, adaptive layout and allows users to connect their integrations in any order.

This also enables the ability to use [one-time Link URLs](/updates/250110-secure-linking). Please inform us if you want to use one-time passwords.
