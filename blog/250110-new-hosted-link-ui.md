Our Hosted Link flow UI has been updated with a cleaner layout and now allows users to connect their integrations in any order. 

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We have updated the user interface (UI) of our Hosted Link experience to match the experience provided by the Link SDK. The Hosted Link flow now boasts a cleaner, adaptive layout and allows users to connect their integrations in any order.

By default this will also enable [one-time Link URLs](/updates/250110-secure-linking). Please inform us if you do not want to use one time passwords.

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant for clients who use our Hosted Link flow to connect their SMB customer data.

## How to get started?

Contact your Codat account manager with the request to enable the new Hosted Link flow. Additionally, inform them if you want to disable the use of one-time Link URLs, otherwise one-time URLs will be enabled together with the new flow.
