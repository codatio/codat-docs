Traditionally, lenders look up a bank statement to verify that payments for an invoice were received, and that payment dates and amounts are accurate.

The Enhanced Invoices Report uses open banking and accounting data to automatically match a paid invoice to the bank transaction record that was used to pay it. This helps to verify a customerâ€™s payment against the company's historical invoice.

See [Enhanced Invoices](https://docs.codat.io/lending/enhanced-invoices/overview) for more information.
