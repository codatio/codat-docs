You can now sync reimbursable expenses with your small business customers’ accounting software using our new transaction type for Sync for Expenses. 

<!--truncate-->

## What’s new? ​

This update allows you to create and update reimbursable expenses, representing transactions that have been paid out-of-pocket by employees that have to be refunded or compensated by their employer. 

This is in addition to the existing expense and transfer transaction types, helping providers more easily embed accounting automation features across their customers’ spend management workflows. 

## Who is this relevant for?​

With this update, neobanks, corporate card and spend management providers can fully support the syncing of reimbursements or out-of-pocket expenses between their product and their clients’ accounting software. 

## How to get started? 

Existing [Sync for Expenses](/expenses/overview) clients can create new reimbursable expense transactions using the [Create reimbursable expense transaction](/sync-for-expenses-api#/operations/create-reimbursable-expense-transaction) endpoint. For more information, [check out our docs](/expenses/sync-process/reimbursable-expense-transactions).
