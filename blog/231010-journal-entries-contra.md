On October 10, 2023, Codat will change the mappings for contra manual journal entries on the `billPayments` and `payments` data types in QuickBooks Online.

<!--truncate-->

Manual Journal Contra (offsetting AP against AR) entries will no longer be mapped to Codat's `billPayments` and `payments` data model. These manual journal entries will instead be found in the `journalEntries` data type.
