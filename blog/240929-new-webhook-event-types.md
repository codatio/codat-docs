We're excited to introduce our improved webhook event types. They offer more contextual information within the webhook message and support stateless architectures better. 

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We are replacing our existing rule types with an updated set of event types. These event types add granularity and context to our webhooks, allow you to increase precision of your webhook messages, and provide detailed insights into the trigger events. 

- Check out the full range of our [webhook event types](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types).

We have also adopted the [standard webhooks payload specification](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md#payload-structure) payload specification. As a result, here's what's changed:

1. **Standardized top-level schema**

  Event type schemas now conform to a default structure. It ensures the top-level properties are the same between all event types, making ingestion simpler. 
  
  ```json title="Default schema structure"
  {
    "id": "bae71d36-ff47-420a-b4a6-f8c9ddf41140",
    "eventType": "company.created",
    "generatedDate": "2024-09-29T20:26:10.344522Z",
    "payload": {
      // Properties specific to event types
    }
  }
  ```

2. **Full payloads**

  We've chosen to support full payloads, providing complete the data in each payload. This lets our webhooks to function more like a reverse API.

3. **Reference company property**

  Webhooks that include information about a specific company now have a `referenceCompany` property in their payload. It provides access to the companyâ€™s ID, name, description, links, and tags. 
  
  Tags are key-value pairs you can define when creating or updating a company. Use them to pass metadata, such as a foreign key, to your webhook consumer. Start with our documentation to [add tags to a company](/using-the-api/managing-companies#add-metadata-to-a-company).
  
  ```json title="Reference company property"
  {
      "id": "bae71d36-ff47-420a-b4a6-f8c9ddf41140",
      "eventType": "company.created",
      "generatedDate": "2024-09-29T20:26:10.344522Z",
      "payload": {
          "referenceCompany": {
          "id": "5e505642-9024-474d-9434-e5a44f505cc5",
          "name": "Toft stores",
          "description": "Looking to get a loan for refurd.",
          "links": {
              "portal": "https://app.codat.io/companies/{companyId}/summary"
          },
          "tags": {
              "clientDefinedKey": "clientDefinedValue",
          }
      },
      // Properties specific to event types
    }
  }
  ```
