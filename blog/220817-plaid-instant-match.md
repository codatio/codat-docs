> Instant Match is available for nearly 3,000 U.S. additional financial institutions where Instant Auth is not available.

<!--truncate-->

> Instant Match is enabled automatically for Auth customers and is automatically provided at supported institutions as a fallback experience when Instant Auth is not available. When using Instant Match, Plaid Link will prompt your user to enter their account number and routing number for a depository account. Plaid will then verify the last four digits of the user-provided account number against the account mask retrieved from the financial institution.
