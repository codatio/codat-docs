Intuit will be launching a [new App Partner Program](https://blogs.intuit.com/2025/05/15/introducing-the-intuit-app-partner-program/) on the 28th of July.

<!--truncate-->

The new program aims to introduce an improved developer experience but may impact apps that currently have a high volume of calls to Intuit APIs, with the introduction of tiered program and variable API fees. You can refer to a [full overview of the program](https://blogs.intuit.com/2025/05/15/introducing-the-intuit-app-partner-program/) and [FAQs](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/get-started/partner-faq) for additional context.

### Integrations effected

- QuickBooks Online

QuickBooks Desktop should not be effected by these changes.

### Next Steps

Codat is working with Intuit to assess current volume of all Codat supported QuickBooks apps, and will be in touch directly in the coming weeks to any clients where we would recommend any integration changes.

### Timeline of the app partner roll out

- **July 28th:** New app partner program rolled out
- **July 28 - October 31st:** For app partners headquartered in the US, variable API fees incurred between July 28 and October 31st will be discounted at 100%.
- **November 1st:** Variable API fees will begin to apply if usage exceeds included credit amount.
- **Later in the year:** Non-US based partners will start later in the year, with a 30-day advance notification.

### Action Required

None. We will be in touch directly if we need to work with you to make any changes with respect to the program.

If you have any questions, please get in touch with your Codat representative.
