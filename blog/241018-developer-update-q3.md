### Webhooks update: new event types

We're excited to introduce our improved webhook event types. They add context to our webhooks, allow you to increase the precision of your webhook messages, and provide detailed insights into the trigger events. They also use the payload structure recommended by the [Standard Webhooks specification](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md).

### Introducing company tags 

We've enhanced our `company` data model with a `tags` object. Tags provide a simple way to include additional information about a company. 

For example, you can use tags to set a foreign key, define an operating region, or specify details about the financial services the company has requested. Each company can store up to 10 tags. This feature is available to all clients today.

## Changes planned for January 10, 2025

### Deprecation of legacy QuickBooks Desktop Integration

We have recently released our [updated QuickBooks Desktop connector](/updates/240227-qbd-connector). It simplifies your customer’s linking journey and provides more resilient data acquisition.

As a result, we will be deprecating the legacy connector on **January 10, 2025**. Migrate your existing QBD connections to the new connector to continue syncing data with QBD after the deprecation.
