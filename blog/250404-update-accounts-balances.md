We have updated the way we display Current Balances for Chart of Accounts for integrations: Xero, Netsuite, Dynamics 365 BC, Sage Intacct, Sage 50, Sage 200, Zoho Books.

## What's new?

We have updated the signum of accounts balances to represent the status of an Account and bring it in lnline across integrations. Asset/Expense accounts are positive when in debit, and Income/Liability/Equity accounts are positive when in credit.

Xero Income and Expense accounts are now returning current balance.

Dynamics 365 BC Bank Accounts are now returning balance.

Sage50 Bank Accounts current balances are now returned in the bank accountâ€™s currency.

## Who is this relevant for?

Anyone using balances from Chart of Accounts as part of their implementation.
