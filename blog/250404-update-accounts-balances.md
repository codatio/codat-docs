We have updated the way we display account current balance in our Xero, NetSuite, Dynamics 365 BC, Sage Intacct, Sage 50, Sage 200, and Zoho Books integrations.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We have standardized the way we convert the `currentBalance` signage (signum) of our [Account](/lending-api#/schemas/AccountingAccount) data type across our **Xero**, **NetSuite**, **Dynamics 365 BC**, **Sage Intacct**, **Sage 50**, **Sage 200**, and **Zoho Books** integrations:

- _Asset_ and _Expense_ accounts now show positive `currentBalance` when in debit.
- _Income_, _Liability_, and _Equity_ accounts now show positive `currentBalance` when in credit.

These changes apply to our **entire solution suite** and ensure consistent interpretation of balances across integrations, improving accuracy in reporting and analysis.

As a result, you will see some changes to how we present data for the following integrations: 

- **Xero**: _Income_ and _Expense_ accounts now return a `currentBalance` value instead of `null`.
- **Dynamics 365 BC**: accounts with `isBankAccount: true` now return a `currentBalance` value instead of `null`.
- **Sage50**: accounts with `isBankAccount: true` now return a `currentBalance` in bank accountâ€™s currency.

## Who is this relevant for?

This improvement is relevant for all clients that use the `currentBalance` field of our [Account](/lending-api#/schemas/AccountingAccount) (also known as Chart of Accounts) data type as part of their integration or financial reporting setup.

## How to get started?

The update is already available for all clients. To reflect the changes in the data, schedule a Chart of Accounts data sync.
