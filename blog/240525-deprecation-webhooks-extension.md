On **April 8, 2024**, Codat announced a number of deprecations following the release of our new webhook service.


<!--truncate-->

A small number of customers where impacted due to functionality that is not currently supported by our new service.
We have therefore extended the deprecation window for the following notices from **July 10, 2024** to **October 10, 2024**.

- [`/rules/alerts` endpoints](/updates/240306-deprecation-rules-alerts).
- [RuleId in rules webhooks](/updates/240320-deprecation-ruleId).
- [Rule-based email notifications](/updates/240405-deprecation-rule-based-email-notifications).

As part of this update, we have announced a deprecation for clients [paginating and/or querying the *List /rules endpoint*](/updates/240521-deprecation-pagination-querying-rules-endpoint).
