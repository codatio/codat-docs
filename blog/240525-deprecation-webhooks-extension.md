On **April 8, 2024**, Codat announced a number of deprecations following the release of our [new webhooks service](/updates/240306-new-webhook-service-released). The deprecation date for some of these notices has now changed. 

<!--truncate-->

A small number of our customers were impacted because they are using a functionality that is not currently supported by our new service. We have therefore extended the deprecation window for the following notices from **July 10, 2024** to **October 10, 2024**:

- [`/rules/alerts` endpoints](/updates/240306-deprecation-rules-alerts)
- [RuleId in rules webhooks](/updates/240320-deprecation-ruleId)
- [Rule-based email notifications](/updates/240405-deprecation-rule-based-email-notifications)

As part of this update, we are announcing another deprecation for clients [paginating and/or querying the *List /rules* endpoint](/updates/240525-deprecation-pagination-querying-rules-endpoint).
