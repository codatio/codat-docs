## What's new?

The **Credit Model Report** is now available to download via the Codat **Portal** and **API**.

The report brings together accounting and banking data into a single, structured view to support faster and more consistent underwriting decisions. It includes:

- **Dashboard** – a consolidated view of a borrower’s overall financial health  
- **Credit score** – a customizable credit score aligned to the metrics most relevant to your lending criteria  
- **Accounting score** – an assessment of the quality, completeness, and reliability of the borrower’s bookkeeping  
- **Financial summary** – automatically spread financial statements with calculated metrics and ratios  
- **Bank summary** – bank transaction data transformed into a cash-based profit and loss statement  
- **Debt summary** – a breakdown of existing debt with historical and projected repayment terms  
- **Customer summary** – receivables analysis, including terms, concentration, and payment punctuality  
- **Repayment summary** – payables analysis, including terms, concentration, and payment punctuality  

For details on supported data types and integrations, see the [Credit Model documentation](/lending/premium-products/credit-model-overview).
