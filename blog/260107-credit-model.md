- **Dashboard** – a consolidated view of a borrower’s overall financial health
- **Credit score** – a customizable credit score aligned to the metrics most relevant to your lending criteria
- **Accounting score** – an assessment of the quality, completeness, and reliability of the borrower’s bookkeeping
- **Financial summary** – automatically spread financial statements with calculated metrics and ratios
- **Bank summary** – bank transaction data transformed into a cash-based profit and loss statement
- **Debt summary** – a breakdown of existing debt with historical and projected repayment terms
- **Customer summary** – receivables analysis, including terms, concentration, and payment punctuality
- **Repayment summary** – payables analysis, including terms, concentration, and payment punctuality

The **Credit Model report** is now available to download via the Codat **Portal** and **API**.
