We'll be launching our new service email feature soon. Use it to automatically inform your customers when they need to reconnect their integration, their banking connection is due to expire, and more. 

**You can opt in early to benefit from this functionality.**

<!--truncate-->

Service emails increase customer engagement and offer them a way to reconnect their account, ensuring your connection to their data is resilient.

## What's new?

When you enable this early-access feature, Codat will notify your customers by email whenever:

 - **Your customer successfully shares data with you.**

   We will reassure your customer that they have successfully connected their data with you and give them a way to manage the status of their connection.
  
 - **Your customer's data connection has been unlinked.**

   We will inform your customer that you can no longer access their data and give them a way to reauthorize the connection.

Example emails your customers will receive are presented below:

#### Connection successfully linked

## Who is this relevant for?

All Codat clients can opt in and start using the customer service email functionality early.
