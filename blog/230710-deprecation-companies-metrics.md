On July 10, 2023, Codat will deprecate the `GET /metrics/companies` endpoint previously used to display the status of companies on the Portal dashboard.

<!--truncate-->

It provided the following status metrics:

- Currently linked
- No longer linked
- Not yet linked
- All time linked.

The internal logic of the dashboard has changed, and the endpoint is no longer in use. After the change is implemented, any requests made to `GET /metrics/companies` will return a 404 error.

## Action required​

If you are using the current `GET /metrics/companies` endpoint to perform monitoring outside of the Portal dashboard, make sure to use alternative API calls instead. You can obtain data connection statuses from the `GET /companies` endpoint.

## Expected impact if no action is taken​

After July 10, 2023, calls made to the `GET /metrics/companies` endpoint will return a `404 Endpoint deprecated` error.
