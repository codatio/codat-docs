Our webhook event catalog now displays deprecation flags against properties that have been deprecated.

### What's new?

We are excited to announce we've introduced deprecation flags to our webhook event catalog. This enhancement is designed to help you easily identify which properties are deprecated and should no longer be used when building to a webhook event type.

#### Key benefits

- **Clear identification**: easily spot deprecated properties in the webhook payload.
- **Up-to-date integrations**: be confident that your builds use the most current supported properties.

### Who is it relevant for?

These changes are relevant for all developers using our new webhook service.

Not using the new service yet? See how you can migrate in our [migration guide](/using-the-api/webhooks/migration-guide).

### How to get started?

There's nothing you need to do — these updates are already available in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/).
