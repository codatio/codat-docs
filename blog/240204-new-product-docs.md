Codat's documentation got a refresh - now with a focus on what matters most. 

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

As we focus on supporting you in building deeper connections with your business customers, we reorganized our documentation so you can find the solutions you need, fast.

Each of Codat's solutions is tailored to a specific use case we're experts in, so our homepage and navigation structure put these flagship use cases front and center. Our range of solutions also boasts updated, clearer names while delivering the same reliable insights and best-in-class experience you are used to. 

### Codat for business users

<Products mini={true} verbose={true} products={["Supplier Enablement"]}/>

### Codat for technology teams

<Products mini={true} verbose={true} products={["Lending", "Expenses", "Bill Pay", "Bank Feeds"]}/>

## Who is this relevant for?

If you are Codat's existing or prospective client, this update is for you - our new look helps you quickly access the most relevant content and discover our solutions at a glance. Our spring refresh doesn't affect Codat's features, functionality, or the build process.

## How to get started?

You can take advantage of the refresh immediately. Simply navigate to [our homepage](https://docs.codat.io) and start browsing!
