Following the [release of version 2.0](/updates/250108-zapier-integration-v2) of our Zapier app, we will deprecate version 1.0 on **April 10, 2025**.

<!--truncate-->

## Action required

We have released a new version of our Zapier app that supports our latest webhook [event types](/using-the-api/webhooks/event-types). To ensure uninterrupted service of your workflows, update your existing Zaps to use the latest version of our app. Follow these steps:

1. Identify your [active Zaps](https://zapier.com/app/assets/zaps) that use version 1.0 of the Codat app.
2. Click the Zap you want to edit, then click **Edit** on the Zap's trigger tile.
3. On the trigger detail screen, click **Setup**, then click **Update** and follow on-screen instructions.

## Expected impact if no action is taken

If you donâ€™t update your Zaps by **April 10, 2025**, your workflows will stop functioning because version 1.0 will no longer receive legacy event types. Ensure your workflows continue without interruption by updating the Zaps today.
