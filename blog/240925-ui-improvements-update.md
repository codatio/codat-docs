We have released user interface improvements for our NetSuite, Sage Intacct, and QuickBooks Desktop connection flows. 

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We have revised and improved the connection flows a small business customer goes through when connecting NetSuite, Sage Intacct, and QuickBooks Desktop. We have added:

- A **clean and consistent layout and design** to provide recognizable experience across all our linking journeys.
- **Improved and simplified copy** that provides enhanced guidance to the user going through the flow.
- **Generated username and password values** (where required by the software to create these) the user can copy and past to remove ambuguity.
- **Deep links** in the linking journey take users directly to the pages they need to execute the steps of the flow.

The flows also include links to documentation that supports your SMB customer in their connection journey and allows them to troubleshoot as they go. See our dedicated [NetSuite](/smb-help-hub/integrations/netsuite/overview), [Sage Intacct](/smb-help-hub/integrations/sage-intacct/overview), and [QuickBooks Desktop](/smb-help-hub/integrations/qb-desktop/overview) end user documentation.

### NetSuite

In addition to the above changes, the NetSuite flow now has:

- A reduced number of steps required to connect successfully, simplifying user experience and increasing completion rates.
- Enhanced error management experience with improved guidance and direct links to self-serve resolutions.

### Sage Intacct

The Sage Intacct linking journey has the following additional improvements:

- It bases the connection on Sage Intacct's Web Services user, making the connection significantly less likely to expire and deauthorize. 
- It caters for both user-based and role-based Sage Intacct company setups, adjusting the journey accordingly.

QuickBooks Desktop connection flow now benefits from these additional enhancements:

- It is now tailored to multiple QBD access options and includes support for a new option. 
- It has increased flow control, ensuring the user only proceeds to the next steps after completing the previous ones.
