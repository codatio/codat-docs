We have released user interface improvements for our **NetSuite**, **Sage Intacct**, and **QuickBooks Desktop** connection flows.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We have revised and improved the connection flows a small business customer goes through when connecting NetSuite, Sage Intacct, and QuickBooks Desktop. We have added:

- A **clean and consistent layout and design** to provide recognizable experiences across all our linking journeys.
- **Improved and simplified copy** that provides enhanced guidance to the user going through the flow.
- **Autogenerated username and password values** the user can copy and paste to remove ambiguity.
- **Deep links** in the linking journey take users directly to the pages they need to execute the steps of the flow.
- Links to **end user documentation** that supports your customer in their journey and allows them to troubleshoot as they go.

See our dedicated [NetSuite](https://help.codat.io/integrations/netsuite/overview), [Sage Intacct](https://help.codat.io/integrations/sage-intacct/overview), and [QuickBooks Desktop](https://help.codat.io/integrations/qb-desktop/overview) **end user documentation**.
