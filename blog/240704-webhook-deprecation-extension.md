We have extended the deprecation window for our previously announced webhook changes.

<!--truncate-->

On **April 10, 2024** we announced three deprecations following the release of our new webhooks service:

- [Deprecation of `/rules/alerts` endpoints](/updates/240306-deprecation-rules-alerts)
- [Deprecation of RuleId in rules webhooks](/updates/240320-deprecation-ruleId)
- [Deprecation of rule-based email notifications](/updates/240405-deprecation-rule-based-email-notifications)

To ensure a smooth transition, we are extending the deprecation period to **January 10, 2025**.

## Action required

Clients using the legacy webhook service must migrate to our new service and address the following deprecations.

### Deprecation of `/rules/alerts` endpoints

The following endpoints will be deprecated:

- `GET /rules/alerts`
- `GET /rules/{ruleId}/alerts`
- `GET /rules/alerts/{alertId}`

#### Action required 

Review and update your application logic to remove any dependencies on the deprecated endpoints. This will help prevent any disruptions to your integration with Codat.

#### Expected impact

If no action is taken by **January 10, 2025**, your application will fail when retrieving rules alerts programmatically. The deprecated endpoints will return `Not found` (404) status codes, preventing your application from functioning normally.

### Deprecation of `RuleId` in rules webhooks

The `RuleId` property will be deprecated in the following webhook rule schemas:

- [Company data connection status changed](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#company-data-connection-status-changed)
- [New company synchronized](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#new-company-synchronized)
- [Data sync completed](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#data-sync-completed)
- [Dataset data changed](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#dataset-data-changed)
- [Dataset status has changed to an error state](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#dataset-status-has-changed-to-an-error-state)
- [Push operation status has changed](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#push-operation-status-has-changed)
- [Push operation has timed out](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#push-operation-has-timed-out)
- [Account categories updated](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#account-categories-updated)
- [Sync Connection Deleted](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#sync-connection-deleted)
- [Expenses sync completed](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#expenses-sync-completed)
- [Expenses sync failed](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#expenses-sync-failed)
- [Client rate limit reached](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#client-rate-limit-reached)
- [Client rate limit reset](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/core-rules-types#client-rate-limit-reset)

#### Action required 

Review and update your application logic to remove any dependencies on the `RuleId`. This will help prevent any disruptions to your integration with Codat.

You should use `RuleType` to identify what event a given webhook corresponds with.

#### Expected impact

If no action is taken by **January 10, 2025**, your application will continue to receive events, but the `RuleId` will not be populated. 

Any application logic using the `RuleId` property will function following your unhappy path for `RuleId` logic. Depending on your implementation, this may impact your processing Codat's webhooks.

### Deprecation of rule-based email notifications

Email notifications are currently managed by our webhook rules service. After the deprecation date, this service will no longer exist. Instead, you can use our [Zapier integration](/using-the-api/webhooks/zapier-integration) to trigger automated workflows that send an email notification or a Slack message.

#### Action required 

To continue receiving email notifications, use our [Zapier integration](/using-the-api/webhooks/zapier-integration) to create a workflow using the 'Email by Zapier' action.

#### Expected impact

If no action is taken by **January 10, 2025**, you will stop receiving email notifications created using our [Receive webhooks events via email](/using-the-api/webhooks/legacy/receive-webhooks-as-email) feature.
