QuickBooks Desktop is now live on Sync for Expenses.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?  

We have expanded our Sync for Expenses coverage to QuickBooks Desktop, enabling clients to automate creating a Check or Credit Card Charge in their customers' QuickBooks Desktop account whenever they incur spend on their corporate card, as well as automate creating a reimbursable expense (bill) in their customers' QuickBooks Desktop account for employee expense claims.

## Who is this relevant for?  

Any client using Sync for Expenses.

## How to get started?  

Check out our documentation on how to [set up the QuickBooks Desktop integration](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/installing-the-quickbooks-connector), together with our [Sync for Expenses API](/sync-for-expenses-api) documentation.
