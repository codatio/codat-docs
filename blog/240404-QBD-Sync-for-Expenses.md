We've expanded our [Expenses](/expenses/overview) platform coverage to include support for QuickBooks Desktop.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?  

We have expanded the platform coverage of our [Expenses](/expenses/overview) solution to include QuickBooks Desktop. This enables you to automate the creation of a Check or Credit Card Charge in your customers' QuickBooks Desktop account whenever they incur spend on their corporate card and the creation of a reimbursable expense (bill) for employee expense claims.

## Who is this relevant for?  

All clients using or planning to use Codat's [Expenses](/expenses/overview) solution.

## How to get started?  

Want to enable Zoho Books support for your application? [Set up the QuickBooks Desktop integration](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/installing-the-quickbooks-connector) using our docs and review our [Expenses API](/sync-for-expenses-api) documentation.
