## What's new?

The **Closed Books Date Indicator** is now available via API as part of Codat’s [Lending](/lending/overview) solution.  
This parameter lets you determine the most recent accounting period officially **closed** by a business.  
It supports more accurate and efficient credit risk decisions by ensuring your analysis is based on **complete and reliable financial data**.

The Closed Books Indicator is available across all supported accounting integrations.

## Who is this relevant for?

All clients who need to know when their customers have officially closed their books to improve financial analysis and credit decisioning.

## How to get started?

Contact your **Account Manager** or our **support team** to enable this feature.  
Once enabled, follow our [API documentation](/lending-api#/operations/get-closed-books-indicator) to implement the Closed Books Date Indicator in your application.
