You can now update existing bills directly through our Bill Pay solution.

## What's new?

We've expanded our [Bill Pay](/payables/overview) solution with the new [Update bills](/sync-for-payables-v2-api#/operations/update-bill) endpoint. 

No more deleting and recreating bills just to fix a typo or a changed line item. With this update, your customers can edit bills in their accounting software, and we will automatically sync these changes to your platform, keeping the records accurate and up-to-date.

The endpoint currently supports our FreeAgent, QuickBooks Online, and Xero integrations. 

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant for all clients using Codat's Bill Pay solution who want to give their customers a seamless bill management experience.

## How to get started?

You can start using the endpoint right now. Check out the [Update bills](/sync-for-payables-v2-api#/operations/update-bill) endpoint in our API reference, or explore Bill Pay's [Update bills](/payables/sync/update-bill) documentation for a full walkthrough.
