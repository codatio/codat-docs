We've recently upgraded our login and security management service. As a result, users who log in to Codat with an **email and password** may need to reset their password after **February 3, 2025**.

<!--truncate-->

## Action required

If you signed up for a Codat account using **email and password** but haven't logged in to the [Portal](https://app.codat.io/) or the [Relationship Manager](https://relationships.codat.io/) before **February 3, 2025**, you will receive an email prompting you to reset your password. 

Follow the instructions in the email to restore access to Codat’s services and avoid disruptions to your use of our solutions. Other users don't need to take any action. 

## Expected impact if no action is taken

After **February 3, 2025** users who still haven’t logged into Codat's services will need to reset their password before accessing their account. We will send an automated password reset email to the affected users on this date.
