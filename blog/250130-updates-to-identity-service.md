We've recently upgraded our login and security management service. As a result, users who log in to Codat with an **email and password** may need to reset their password after **February 3, 2025**.

<!--truncate-->

## Action required

If you signed up for a Codat account using **email and password** but haven't logged in to the [Portal](https://app.codat.io/) or the [Relationship Manager](https://relationships.codat.io/) between **January 13, 2025** and **February 3, 2025**, you will receive an email detailing action required to keep access to your account.

Follow the instructions in the email to and reset your account password.
Once you've done this, you'll be able to sign in with that new password and access Codat’s services.

## Expected impact if no action is taken

After **February 3, 2025** users who still haven’t logged into Codat's services will need to reset their password before accessing their account. We will send an automated password reset email to the affected users on this date.
