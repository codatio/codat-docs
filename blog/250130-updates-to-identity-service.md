We've recently upgraded our service that manages user logins and security. As a result, starting **Monday, February 10, 2025**, some users may need to reset their password if they haven't logged in to the portal or the relationship manager.

<!--truncate-->

## Action required

To avoid any disruptions, log in to either the [portal](https://app.codat.io/) or the [relationship manager](https://relationships.codat.io/) by **February 10, 2025**.

## Expected impact if no action is taken

If you have not logged into the portal or the relationship manager before the deadline, you will be unable to access your account without resetting your password.

In this case, you will receive an email with instructions to reset your password.
