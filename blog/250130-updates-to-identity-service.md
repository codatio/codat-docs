We've recently upgraded our service that manages user logins and security. As a result, starting **Monday, February 3, 2025**, some users may need to reset their password if they haven't logged in to the [Portal](https://app.codat.io/) or the [Relationship manager](https://relationships.codat.io/).

<!--truncate-->

This change only affects users who log in with an **email and password**.

## Action required

If you created your account using **email and password** but have **not logged in before the deadline**, you will receive an email prompting you to reset your password.
Follow the instructions to restore access to Codat’s portals.

## Expected impact if no action is taken

After **February 3, 2025**, users who haven’t logged in will need to **reset their password** before accessing their account. A password reset email will be sent on this date with instructions to complete the process.
