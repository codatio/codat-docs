Zoho Books is now live on Sync for Expenses.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?  

We have expanded our Sync for Expenses coverage to Zoho Books, enabling clients to automate creating an Expense in their customers' Zoho Books account whenever they incur spend on their corporate card, as well as automate creating a reimbursable expense (bill) in their customers' Zoho Books account for employee expense claims.

## Who is this relevant for?  

Any client using Sync for Expenses.

## How to get started?  

Check out our documentation on how to [set up the Zoho Books integration](/integrations/accounting/zoho-books/accounting-zohobooks-setup), together with our [Sync for Expenses API](/sync-for-expenses-api) documentation.
