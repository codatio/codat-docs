On July 10, 2023, Codat will change the mappings for the Direct incomes data type for the QuickBooks Desktop on-premise connector.

After this change, the `id` property in Direct incomes will be mapped as `"Deposit ID - Transaction line ID"`.

This changes will ensure that the `id` parameter is unique when Direct incomes are read to QuickBooks Desktop via the connector.
