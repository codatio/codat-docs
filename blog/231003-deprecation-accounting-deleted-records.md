On **January 10, 2024**, we will change how we handle data deleted by users in accounting software.

<!--truncate-->

When data is deleted by a user in the SMB's accounting software between two successive data reads, Codat sets the `metaData.isDeleted` property to `true`. This ensures there is consistency in records returned between successive data reads and clearly identifies records deleted by a user.

**Today, for some data types, Codat also updates the `status` property of the deleted record. **

For example:
- Codat retrieves a invoice from Xero with a status of `Submitted`.
- The invoice is then manually deleted from within Xero.
- Codat retrieves data from Xero a second time, and reconciles the fact that the invoice has been deleted by changing the status of the invoice within Codat to `void`.

## New behavior

From January 10, 2024, **we will no longer update the `status` property of deleted records** and change it to `void`. Instead, we will preserve the last known `status` before the record was deleted by the user.

See [Impacted data types](#impacted-data-types) for full details of relevant data types and associated statuses we will no longer update.

## Action required

Ensure that any workflows handling deleted records use the `metaData.isDeleted` property instead of the `status` property.

## Expected impact if no action is taken

Any workflows relying on the data type's `status` property to identify and handle deleted records will cease to work as expected.
