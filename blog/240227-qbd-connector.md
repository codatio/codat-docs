We’ve released a new QuickBooks Desktop connector, providing an improved user journey and best-in-class linking experience. 

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

With this release, we have: 

- Migrated the connector to our next-generation architecture, which provides more resilient data acquisition. 
- Simplified the linking journey for your small business customers.
- Streamlined the connectivity to hosted QuickBooks environments. This means that Rightworks (formerly Right Networks) and QuickBooks Enterprise Cloud no longer require connector installation, certification or minimum client commitment. 

You can read more about the changes in our [QuickBooks Desktop (on-premise) documentation](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/accounting-quickbooksdesktop).

## Who is this relevant for? 

The new QuickBooks Desktop connector will be automatically enabled for all new Codat clients.

Our existing clients can continue using their current version of the connector. The update doesn't impact your current connected companies, and you don't need to make any changes. We continue supporting the existing QuickBooks Desktop integration in full.

## How to get started? 

All new connections for QuickBooks Desktop for new Codat clients will automatically follow the updated Link flow, which utilizes the new connector. Migrating to the new connector involves: 

- Testing, supported by Codat and available alongside the existing connector.
- Re-authenticating existing connected companies. 

If you'd like to get started, or to find out more about the new connector, contact your Codat Account Manager.
