## What's new?

We've added new branding settings that give you greater control over how [Link](/auth-flow/overview) looks and feels to your customers. These updates are designed to help you create a seamless, trusted connection experience that reinforces your brand at every step.

    display: "flex",

### Company logo on landing page

You can now prominently display the logo from your existing [Branding](/auth-flow/customize/branding) settings on the first connection screen your customers see.

Navigate to **Settings > Auth flow > Link > Onboarding** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/onboarding) and enable the _Company logo_ setting. You must also have the _Landing page_ toggle enabled.

### Navigation bar

The new _Navigation bar_ setting adds a branded bar to the top of the Link flow using your secondary brand color, reinforcing your identity throughout the entire journey.

Navigate to **Settings > Auth flow > Link > Onboarding** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/onboarding) to enable this setting.

### Secondary color

You can now set a _Secondary color_, exercising finer control over the look and feel of the connection flow. This color is used by the new [Navigation bar](/updates/260218-link-branding-updates#navigation-bar) element of the Link flow.

Navigate to **Settings > Auth flow > Branding** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding) to configure this setting.

### Hero image

Add a background to the main content area of Link using the _Hero image_ setting. This lets you set the visual tone of the authorization experience from the moment your customers land on the page.

Navigate to **Settings > Auth flow > Branding** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding) to configure this setting.

### Why does this matter?

Customizing Link to further match your branding guidelines helps achieve the following outcomes:

- **Increased trust:** Your customers are more likely to connect their financial data when they see familiar branding from the first screen.
- **Improved conversion:** A cohesive branded interface reduces friction and hesitation during the onboarding flow, helping you convert more customers.
- **Seamless experience:** These settings work together to create a connection experience that feels like a native part of your product, not a third party tool.

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant for all clients using [Link](/auth-flow/overview) to connect their customers' financial data. It's especially valuable if you are looking to improve conversion rates and deliver a polished onboarding experience.

## How to get started?

The new branding settings are already available in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io):

1. Navigate to **[Settings > Auth flow > Link > Onboarding](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/onboarding)** to enable the _Company logo_ and _Navigation bar_ toggles.
2. Set your _Company logo_, _Secondary color_, and _Hero image_ in **[Settings > Auth flow > Branding](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding)**.
