We've expanded the branding options available for Link, making it easier than ever to deliver a fully branded, white-label authorization experience that feels like a native part of your product.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

We've added several new branding settings that give you greater control over how [Link](/auth-flow/overview) looks and feels to your customers. These updates are designed to help you create a seamless, trusted connection experience that reinforces your brand at every step.

### Company logo on landing page

Display your **company logo** prominently on the first screen your customers see when they connect their data. The logo is pulled from your existing [Branding settings](/auth-flow/customize/branding) and can be toggled in **[Settings > Auth flow > Link > Onboarding](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/onboarding)** alongside the [Landing page](/auth-flow/customize/customize-link#landing-page) setting.

### Navigation bar

A new **navigation bar** toggle adds a branded bar to the top of the Link flow. The bar uses your secondary brand color, reinforcing your identity throughout the entire journey. Enable this in **[Settings > Auth flow > Link > Onboarding](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/onboarding)**.

### Secondary color

A new **secondary color** setting lets you define the color of the navigation bar in Link, giving you finer control over the look and feel beyond the primary button color. Configure this in **[Settings > Auth flow > Branding](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding)**.

### Hero image

You can now upload a **hero image** that appears as a background in Link, behind the main content area. This lets you set the visual tone of the authorization experience from the moment your customers land on the page. Configure this in **[Settings > Auth flow > Branding](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding)**.

### Why does this matter?

- **Builds trust:** Your customers are more likely to connect their financial data when they see familiar branding from the first screen. A recognizable logo and consistent color scheme signals legitimacy and professionalism.
- **Improves conversion:** A branded, cohesive interface reduces friction and hesitation during the onboarding flow, helping you convert more customers.
- **Seamless experience:** These settings work together to create a white-label experience that feels less like a third-party tool and more like a native part of your product.

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant for all clients using [Link](/auth-flow/overview) to connect their customers' financial data. It's especially valuable if you're looking to improve conversion rates and deliver a polished onboarding experience.

## How to get started?

These branding options are available now. To configure them:

1. Enable the **Company logo** and **Navigation bar** toggles in **[Settings > Auth flow > Link > Onboarding](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/onboarding)**.
2. Set your **company logo**, **secondary color**, and **hero image** in **[Settings > Auth flow > Branding](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding)**.
