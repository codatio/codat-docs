On **April 10, 2025**, we will deprecate our legacy Hosted Link user interface following the release of our new Hosted Link UI.

:::note Updated March 27, 2025

This page has been updated to reflect the change to the default state of one-time Link URLs.

The new [Hosted Link interface](/updates/250110-new-hosted-link-ui) boasts a cleaner, adaptive layout to match our Link SDK user experience and allows you to enable [one-time Link URLs](/updates/250110-secure-linking):

## Action required

Contact your Codat account manager with the request to enable the new Hosted Link flow. Additionally, inform them if you want to **enable** the use of one-time Link URLs.

You can learn more about the new [Hosted Link interface](/updates/250110-new-hosted-link-ui) and [one-time Link URLs](/updates/250110-secure-linking) before submitting your request.

## Expected impact if no action is taken

If you haven't enabled the new Hosted Link UI by **April 10, 2025**, we will automatically enable it for you.

After **April 10, 2025**, you won't be able to return to using the legacy Hosted Link interface.
