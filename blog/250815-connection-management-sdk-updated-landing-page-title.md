## What's new?

We are making a minor copy change to the landing page of our [**Connection Management SDK**](/auth-flow/optimize/connection-management).  
From **October 10, 2025**, the page title will be updated from:

> **Manage connections**

to:

> **Manage connected accounts**

This small change aligns our terminology more closely with how end-users think about their linked services and provides greater clarity in the UI.

## Who is this relevant for?

Any client using our **Connection Management SDK** in their product who wants to ensure end-user guidance and documentation match the in-app experience.

## How to get started?

No action is required on your side â€” the title change will be automatically applied on **October 10, 2025**. If you reference this page title in your own documentation or help articles, you may wish to update those references for consistency.
