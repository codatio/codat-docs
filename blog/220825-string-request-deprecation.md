On January 10, 2023 we will update the structure of the request body for requests to the `POST /companies/{companyId}/connections` endpoint to use a JSON object instead of a raw text string.

<!--truncate-->

To use the updated request body before this date, enable the relevant feature button in the Portal.

Action required
Update the body of any requests to the `POST /companies/{companyId}/connections` endpoint from a string value to the JSON object as specified below:


```JSON
{
  "platformKey": "string",
}
```

Currently, the platform key in the request body is entered as a raw text string. For example:

â€œplatformKey"

#### Expected impact if no action is taken

A POST request body that is not a JSON object containing a platformKey property will be rejected with the following error:

```JSON

{
    "statusCode": 400,
    "service": "PublicApi",
    "error": "Push object DataConnectionArgs must be provided",
    "correlationId": "string",
    "validation": {
        "errors": [],
        "warnings": [],
        "_errors": [],
        "_warnings": [],
        "_internals": []
    },
    "canBeRetried": "Unknown",
    "detailedErrorCode": 0
}
```

### Further information

Legacy request body for `POST /companies/{companyId}/connections endpoint` available only for clients onboarded prior to September 1, 2022. This model is being replaced on January 10, 2023.
