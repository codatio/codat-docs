We have expanded our accounting integration coverage to include **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations**.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

You can now use Codat to connect and exchange data with **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations** (F&O).

As a powerful ERP designed for medium-to-large enterprises, this integration enables you to:

- **Connect securely** using the standard Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
- **Access comprehensive financial data** including suppliers, bills, bill payments, payment methods, direct costs, and accounts.
- **Support complex company structures** with the ability to link and manage data across multiple legal entities.

This addition enables you to serve larger mid-market customers who rely on D365 F&O for their financial management.

## Who is this relevant for?

This update is relevant for all Spend Insights clients who focus on medium-sized and enterprise businesses.

## Limited availability

This integration is currently in a **limited release phase**. To gain access, contact your **Account Manager** or **Customer Success Manager**. They will help you enable the integration and provide guidance specific to your use case.

## How to get started?

Once the integration is enabled, your clients can immediately start sharing their Dynamics 365 F&O data with you. Visit our [Help Hub](https://help.codat.io/integrations/dynamics-fo/overview) for step-by-step connection instructions you can provide to your clients.
