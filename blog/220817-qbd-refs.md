On January 10, 2023, we will change the Write validation for individual lines on Bills and Bill credit notes to allow only one of either accountRef or itemRef per line item.

<!--truncate-->

This will apply to bills and bill credit notes written to QuickBooks Desktop only.

Action required
If your code attempts to write Bills or Bill credit note to Codat with both an accountRef and an itemRef, you will need to update this to write only one or the other.

Expected impact if no action is taken
Any code that attempts to write Bills or Bill credit note to Codat with both an accountRef and an itemRef after January 10, 2023 will result in an error.

You can get ahead of this change by enabling it now in the Portal. Learn how to do that here, or read our change policy here.
