# Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 Deprecations

To streamline our platform and enable us to focus on our key products, Codat is deprecating integrations with low or no usage as well as consolidating multiple product versions into a single variant. This will simplify our support model, create a clearer upgrade path for clients, and enable us to deliver improvements faster.
