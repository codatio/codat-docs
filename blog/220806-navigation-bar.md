The Portal has been rearranged to make accessing Codat functionality and settings more intuitive.

<!--truncate-->

- The vertical navbar has been replaced with a horizontal one, and sections of the Portal have their own vertical nav in its place.
- All settings are now in the settings section.
- We've added a monitor section for the functionality that helps you monitor and maintain a healthy Codat solution.
