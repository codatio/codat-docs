Xero recently announced an update to its [developer pricing model](https://developer.xero.com/pricing?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=&utm_content=&sfmc_key=c8b1eeda830671f40b83388d8b0e1207051d1b09-R0wgNDg0NSBPIE9USCBPVEggLSBQcm9qZWN0IFNlbnRpbmVsIC0gRW1haWwgIzEgLSBNYWluIEVtYWls) with plans to introduce a tiered, usage-based pricing structure. This will take effect on 2 March 2026, alongside updates to their Developer Terms and Conditions.

## What’s changing?

For ecosystem app partners Xero is introducing five pricing tiers based on:

- Number of customer connections (tenants) linked to your app
- API data egress (how much data your app pulls from Xero via the API)

The tiers each have different connection limits, included API egress usage, and monthly fees.

## Why this matters
Depending on your current connection volumes and API usage, you may need to:
- Select a tier
- Add a payment method in [Xero’s developer portal](http://developer.xero.com/app/manage/) (required once moving beyond Starter)
- Monitor and optimise API usage to manage costs.

## What you should do now
To avoid disruption and ensure you’re ready ahead of March, we recommend you:

- Review [Xero’s pricing and tier model](https://developer.xero.com/pricing?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=&utm_content=&sfmc_key=c8b1eeda830671f40b83388d8b0e1207051d1b09-R0wgNDg0NSBPIE9USCBPVEggLSBQcm9qZWN0IFNlbnRpbmVsIC0gRW1haWwgIzEgLSBNYWluIEVtYWls#tier-fees-connection-limits-and-api-volume-usage)
- Login to your [Xero developer app](http://developer.xero.com/app/manage/) and check your API usage
- Plan for tier selection/billing readiness ahead of March 2026
- Please review your dataset's [sync frequency](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/queueing-data-syncs#sync-frequency) in the Codat portal. It is always reccomended that you only sync data as often as is essential for your use-case.
