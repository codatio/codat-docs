Our webhooks service now supports replaying missed messages on an endpoint.  
This allows you to set up a webhook consumer (or endpoint) and replay messages from up to the past two weeks.

<!--truncate-->

## What's new?

Our webhooks service now caches all generated events, even if no consumers have been configured.  
This means you can request Codat to resend all previously missed events when you start using the webhooks service, on a consumer-by-consumer basis.

## Who is this relevant for?

- **Clients migrating** to our new service who want to ensure no messages are lost during the migration process.  
- **Clients in development** who want to test their solutions with genuine, previously generated events.

## How to get started?

To replay missed events:  
1. Navigate to **Settings > Webhooks > Configure consumers**.  
2. Select an existing consumer or create a new one.  
3. Go to the consumer and click the triple-dot to view settings and select Replay missing messages.  
4. Select the starting date for the messages you wish to replay (up to two weeks).
